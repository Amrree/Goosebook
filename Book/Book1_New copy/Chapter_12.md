# Chapter 12

## Scene 1: The Elder Council Meeting

The Elder Council chambers, usually a bastion of somnolent pronouncements and meticulously recorded minutes, buzzed with an uncharacteristic fury that threatened to crack the very stone walls. The air, thick with the scent of indignation, stale parchment, and the faint, lingering aroma of burnt ambition, crackled with outrage. Mayor Raines, his face a thundercloud of purple and crimson, a veritable human bruise, paced before the assembled Elders, his carefully constructed composure shattered like a dropped teacup. “A breach of tradition!” he thundered, his voice echoing off the stone walls, a sound that usually only accompanied particularly aggressive tax increases. “A blatant disregard for the very fabric of our society! My daughter! Eloped! With… with that… that *orphan*!” The word ‘orphan’ was spat out like a particularly unpleasant hairball, a vile, unspeakable curse in the hallowed halls of Millbrook tradition.

Kael’s father, Elder Thorne, a man whose stern demeanor was only outmatched by his even sterner Wolf Calling, Shadow (currently glaring at a particularly dusty tapestry as if it had personally offended his lineage), rose from his seat. His voice, usually a low rumble of authority, was now a sharp, cutting blade. “This is an affront, Mayor. Not just to your family, but to the entire village. A stain upon our honor, a smudge on the pristine white tablecloth of our reputation. Such defiance cannot go unpunished. It sets a dangerous precedent. What next? Farmers refusing to plant turnips? Bakers refusing to bake bread? Chaos! Utter, unmitigated chaos!” His Wolf Calling let out a low growl, a sound that seemed to agree with the sentiment of impending anarchy, perhaps even contemplating the delicious chaos of a village without bread.

 The Elders, a collection of the village’s most rigid and tradition-bound minds, their faces usually placid masks of authority, were now contorted with a mixture of shock, fear, and a healthy dose of self-righteous indignation. They spoke of “shame,” of “disgrace,” of the “unraveling of order,” as if Ana’s elopement was a personal attack on their meticulously ordered world. Ana’s elopement wasn’t just a personal transgression; it was an existential threat to their meticulously ordered world, a rogue thread threatening to unravel the entire tapestry of their carefully constructed society. They envisioned a future where young people chose their own partners, their own Callings, their own destinies, a terrifying prospect that sent shivers down their collective, traditional spines. The decision was swift, and predictably, severe. A search party would be dispatched. David and Ana would be declared outcasts, their names struck from the village rolls, their very existence erased from the collective memory. A social death, as final as any physical one, a fate worse than a lifetime of pickled turnips.

“And Kael,” Mayor Raines added, his gaze fixed on the young man who stood silently beside his father, his face a mask of controlled fury, his eyes burning with a cold, possessive fire, “will lead the search. He has a… personal stake in this matter. A very personal stake.” Kael’s eyes, cold and hard, met his father’s. A silent understanding passed between them, a shared ambition that transcended words. This wasn’t just about tradition; it was about reclaiming what was perceived as his. And David, the interloper, the goose-herding orphan who dared to steal what was rightfully Kael’s, would pay. Oh, he would pay dearly. The Elders nodded, their faces grim, their decision sealed. The hunt had begun.

## Scene 2: Kael’s Fury and Resolve

Kael’s private training ground, usually a place of disciplined practice and the occasional, perfectly executed sword flourish, was now a maelstrom of raw fury. He swung his practice sword with a vicious intensity, each blow a testament to his rage, his frustration, his wounded pride. The wooden dummy, a stand-in for David, splintered under his assault, its straw stuffing scattering like the remnants of his shattered composure. “Misled!” he snarled, his voice a low growl, a guttural sound of pure, unadulterated hatred. “She was misled! That… that *beggar*! That *scavenger*! He poisoned her mind! He stole her from me! He dared to touch what was mine!” His Wolf Calling, Shadow, a sleek, powerful creature, paced beside him, its eyes mirroring Kael’s own burning obsession, its low growls a symphony of shared vengeance.

His initial shock at Ana’s elopement had quickly curdled into a bitter cocktail of rage and a profound sense of betrayal. Ana was *his*. Destined for him. Her defiance, her choice of David, was an insult, a public humiliation that he would not, could not, tolerate. He saw himself not as a jilted suitor, but as a righteous avenger, reclaiming what was rightfully his, a noble warrior restoring order to a chaotic world. He would bring her back. He would drag her back, if necessary. And David… David would regret the day he ever dared to look at Ana. He would regret the day he was born. He would regret every single breath he had ever taken.

“They won’t get far,” he muttered, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, his voice a chilling whisper of resolve. “The wilderness is unforgiving. And I know every path, every hiding spot, every secret passage. They’ll be cold, hungry, and desperate. And then, she’ll see. She’ll see that I was always the right choice. That I was always the one who could protect her. That I was always the one who truly understood her worth.” His internal monologue was a twisted tapestry of love and entitlement, a dangerous delusion fueled by pride and a possessive desire to reclaim what he believed was his property. He envisioned Ana, broken and contrite, begging for his forgiveness, for his protection. He would lead the search. He would find them. And he would make David pay for his transgression. Shadow let out a low, guttural growl, a sound of agreement, a promise of retribution, a silent vow to hunt down the interloper and bring him to justice. The hunt was on, and Kael, with his burning obsession and his formidable Wolf Calling, was the most dangerous hunter of all.

## Scene 3: Hanna’s Despair and MotherGoose’s Concern

Hanna’s small, cluttered cottage, usually a haven of warmth and the comforting scent of herbs, was filled with a profound despair that clung to the air like a shroud. Hanna, her face etched with grief, sat by the cold hearth, her hands trembling, her eyes red-rimmed and swollen from endless tears. “My Ana,” she whispered, her voice a raw, broken sound. “My little sprout. Out there, alone. With that… that boy. What have they done? What have they done to her? To them both?” She rocked back and forth, a mournful lament escaping her lips, a sound that echoed the quiet sorrow of the cottage.

Elder Goose, who had been quietly observing from his perch on the windowsill, his beady black eyes filled with a profound concern, let out a soft, mournful honk. He waddled over to Hanna, nudging her hand with his beak, a silent offer of comfort, a feathered anchor in her sea of grief. Hanna, usually so attuned to his every nuance, barely registered his presence, lost in her own world of pain. Her attempts to defend Ana to the few villagers who dared to visit had been met with cold condemnation, with whispers of “shame” and “disgrace,” with averted gazes and tight-lipped smiles. They spoke of tradition, of order, of the necessity of punishment, their words like tiny, sharp knives twisting in her already wounded heart.

“They say she’s an outcast,” Hanna sobbed, her voice breaking, a fragile thread in the vast silence. “That she brought shame upon the village. That she defied the very laws of our ancestors. But they don’t understand. They don’t understand what it means to truly love. To choose your own path. To defy a destiny that was never yours to begin with.” She looked at MotherGoose, her eyes pleading for understanding, for a sign, for anything that would alleviate the crushing weight of her despair.

MotherGoose, however, understood. Her quiet observation had always been more perceptive than any human’s. She knew the deeper implications of the elopement, the rigid traditions that had driven them away, the fear that now gripped the village, a fear that manifested in judgment and condemnation. She saw the injustice, the cruelty of a system that valued conformity above all else, that crushed individuality in the name of order. She let out a series of soft, urgent honks, nudging Hanna’s hand again, more insistently this time, her eyes conveying a message of hope, of resilience, of unwavering loyalty. Hanna looked at her, her eyes red-rimmed, a flicker of understanding dawning in their depths. “What is it, old friend? More bad news? Or… a plan?”

MotherGoose shook her head, then waddled to a small, intricately carved wooden box on the shelf, a box that held Hanna’s most precious memories, her most potent charms. She nudged it open with her beak, revealing a single, pristine white feather, its delicate beauty a stark contrast to the darkness that surrounded them. Hanna looked at it, then at MotherGoose, a flicker of understanding in her eyes. The feather. Ana’s Calling. A symbol of defiance, of unexpected destiny, a silent promise of a future yet unwritten. MotherGoose’s subtle actions, her quiet wisdom, hinted at a protective nature, a potential future intervention, a power that transcended the petty laws of the village. The village might condemn, Kael might pursue, but MotherGoose, with her ancient wisdom and her unwavering loyalty, would not stand idly by. The game, she knew, was far from over. It had only just begun.

## Chapter Ending

The village had spoken, and its judgment was swift and severe, a pronouncement that echoed through the narrow streets like a death knell. As Kael rode out, leading the first search party, his face grim and determined, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, a dark, menacing presence at his side, the wind carried not just the dust of their departure, but the chilling echo of his vow: Ana would return, one way or another, and David would pay for his transgression. But back in Hanna’s cottage, a single white feather lay nestled in a wooden box, a silent promise of defiance, a glimmer of hope against the encroaching darkness. The hunt had begun, but the hunted, guided by a love stronger than any tradition, and watched over by a very wise, very opinionated goose, were not alone. The stage was set. The chase was on. And the fate of Millbrook, and perhaps, the very nature of Callings, hung in the balance.
