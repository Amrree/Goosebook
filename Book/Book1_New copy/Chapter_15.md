# Chapter 15

## Scene 1: The Feather's Call

Ana awoke with a start, the single white feather clutched tightly in her hand, its pristine softness a stark contrast to the rough, unfamiliar blanket that had become her constant companion. The room, her gilded prison, felt colder, emptier, but the feather pulsed with a faint, almost imperceptible warmth, a tiny beacon of hope in the suffocating silence. It was a whisper from the outside, a promise that she was not forgotten. She sat up, her heart hammering against her ribs, a desperate prayer forming on her lips, a silent plea to the universe. *Please. Please be real. Please don’t let this be another cruel trick of my despair-addled mind.*

And then, she was there. Not with a dramatic flourish or a burst of blinding light, no trumpets or angelic choirs, but with the quiet dignity of a queen arriving unannounced, perhaps even a queen who had just finished a particularly satisfying nap. MotherGoose, Hanna’s Calling, waddled into the room from seemingly nowhere, her intelligent eyes fixed on Ana with a gaze that seemed to pierce through her very soul. She was larger than Ana remembered, her feathers gleaming with an almost ethereal luminescence, as if she had just bathed in moonlight and stardust. Her presence filled the small room with a comforting, ancient energy, a warmth that chased away the chill of despair. She let out a soft, resonant honk, a sound that, to Ana, felt like a warm embrace, a feathered hug from a very wise, very opinionated friend.

Ana gasped, tears springing to her eyes, a dam of despair finally breaking. “MotherGoose! You came! Oh, MotherGoose, it’s been… it’s been awful. They… they annulled our marriage. They’re forcing me to marry Kael. They took David! I don’t know where he is! I don’t know if he’s even… alive!” Her words tumbled out in a torrent, a frantic, desperate confession, each one a fresh wound. She buried her face in MotherGoose’s soft, downy feathers, the scent of damp earth and wild freedom filling her senses, a stark contrast to the stale air of her confinement, a reminder of the life she had lost, and the life she still yearned for.

MotherGoose listened patiently, her head cocked to one side, her intelligent eyes never leaving Ana’s face, absorbing every word, every tear, every tremor of despair. She nudged Ana’s hand with her beak, a gentle, reassuring gesture, then gently plucked the white feather from her grasp. She held it for a moment, turning it over in her beak, as if examining its very essence, then let it fall, watching it drift to the floor, a silent acknowledgment, a profound understanding that transcended words. Her presence alone was a balm, a comforting weight against the crushing despair, a silent promise that Ana was not alone, that she would not face this battle by herself. Ana felt a surge of renewed determination, a spark of defiance rekindled by the sheer, improbable magic of MotherGoose’s arrival. If MotherGoose was here, then all was not lost. Hope, fragile but fierce, began to bloom in her heart, a tiny, defiant flower pushing through the cracks of her despair. She looked at MotherGoose, her eyes wide with a newfound resolve. “What do we do?” she whispered, her voice firm, ready to fight.

## Scene 2: Confrontation in the Square

The village square, usually a place of mundane commerce and predictable gossip, was transformed into a stage for MotherGoose’s grand entrance, a spectacle that would be talked about for generations. She emerged from Ana’s home, not with a timid waddle, but with a majestic stride, her head held high, her feathers shimmering in the morning sun with an almost blinding luminescence. Ana, walking beside her, felt a surge of confidence she hadn’t known she possessed, her spine straightening, her gaze unwavering. The villagers, drawn by the unusual sight, gathered, their whispers quickly turning to gasps of awe and confusion, their faces a mixture of fear and morbid curiosity. They had seen MotherGoose before, of course, but never like this. Never with such an air of ancient authority, such a palpable sense of purpose.

“People of Millbrook!” MotherGoose honked, her voice surprisingly resonant, carrying across the square with an almost magical clarity, a sound that seemed to vibrate in the very air. “You have witnessed an injustice! You have allowed tradition to blind you to truth! You have condemned love and celebrated deceit! You have allowed a young woman’s heart to be broken for the sake of your petty rules and your even pettier ambitions!” Her words, though simple, struck a chord, echoing in the hearts of those who had felt a flicker of unease at Ana’s public shaming, a silent acknowledgment of the hypocrisy that permeated their lives.

Elder Thorne, Kael’s father, pushed his way to the front, his face a mask of indignation, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, snarling at MotherGoose, its hackles raised, its eyes burning with a fierce, territorial rage. “What is the meaning of this, Goose? You are a Calling! You have no right to interfere in the affairs of men! This is an outrage! A feathered affront to our authority!”

MotherGoose merely fixed him with a gaze that seemed to pierce through his very soul, a gaze that held the wisdom of centuries, the quiet power of the wild. “I am a Calling, Elder Thorne. And I am also a witness. A witness to the ancient laws that predate your petty traditions. Laws of love, of truth, of freedom. Laws that you have trampled underfoot in your pursuit of power and control, like a particularly clumsy ox in a field of delicate wildflowers.” She let out a series of sharp, staccato honks, each one a hammer blow against the Elders’ authority, each one a silent condemnation. “You speak of tradition, yet you betray its very spirit! You speak of honor, yet you shame the innocent! You speak of justice, yet you condemn without mercy, like a particularly unfeeling stone!”

Kael, his face contorted with rage, stepped forward, his hand on the hilt of his sword, his eyes blazing with impotent fury. “Silence, fowl! You overstep your bounds! This is a matter of village law, not some… some feathered philosophy! You are a mere animal! You have no voice here!” He attempted to assert his authority, his voice booming, but it seemed to crack under MotherGoose’s unwavering gaze, his words losing their power, their conviction. Shadow, sensing his master’s frustration, whimpered, its tail drooping, its usual ferocity replaced by a bewildered confusion.

MotherGoose merely let out a single, dismissive honk, a sound that seemed to deflate Kael’s arrogance like a punctured balloon, leaving him sputtering and red-faced. The villagers, witnessing Kael’s loss of control, began to murmur, their awe and fear slowly giving way to confusion, then to a dawning realization. MotherGoose, with her wisdom and her subtle magic, was exposing the injustice, laying bare the hypocrisy of their leaders, like a particularly persistent wind stripping the leaves from a dying tree. The tide was turning. And Ana, standing tall beside her feathered champion, felt a surge of defiant pride, a quiet triumph blooming in her heart. This was her champion. And she would not be silenced. Not by Kael. Not by the Elders. Not by anyone.

## Scene 3: The Elders' Chambers

The Elders’ chambers, usually a place of hushed reverence and the faint scent of old leather and even older secrets, now felt like a battlefield, the air thick with tension and the unspoken weight of centuries of tradition. MotherGoose, with Ana by her side, stood before the assembled Council, her presence radiating an ancient authority that made the very air hum, a palpable force that seemed to vibrate through the very stones of the building. Elder Thorne, his face grim, his usual composure shattered, attempted to regain control, his voice a strained whisper. “This… this is preposterous! A goose, dictating the laws of our village?! This is an affront to everything we stand for!”

“Not dictating, Elder Thorne,” MotherGoose honked, her voice resonating with a power that made the chandeliers tremble, sending tiny dust motes dancing in the filtered light. “Reminding. Reminding you of the laws that truly govern this land. The laws of the Solstice, of the Portal, of the true nature of Callings. Laws that you, in your arrogance, have forgotten, like a particularly forgetful squirrel burying its nuts in the wrong place.” She then launched into a poetic, yet undeniably logical, argument, invoking ancient prophecies, forgotten rituals, and the very spirit of the land itself. She spoke of the sacred bond between a person and their Calling, a bond that could not be broken by human decree, no matter how many dusty scrolls they consulted. She spoke of the Portal’s true purpose, not as a tool for social control, but as a gateway to self-discovery, to a destiny chosen by the heart, not by the village elders, or a particularly ambitious Mayor.

Ana, emboldened by MotherGoose’s unwavering conviction, by the sheer, audacious power of her feathered champion, spoke up, her voice clear and strong, resonating with a newfound confidence. “My marriage to David was consecrated by love, by choice, by the very spirit of the Solstice. Your annulment is a violation of those ancient laws. It is a betrayal of the Portal itself. It is a betrayal of everything this village claims to stand for.” Her words, though simple, carried the weight of truth, a truth that resonated in the silent chambers.

The Elders, their faces a mixture of defiance and dawning fear, shifted uneasily in their seats, their carefully constructed facade of authority beginning to crack. MotherGoose’s arguments were irrefutable, her authority undeniable. She was invoking a power they barely understood, a magic that superseded their petty laws, their bureaucratic pronouncements. Kael, standing in the corner, his face a thundercloud of impotent rage, watched his carefully constructed world crumble around him, his triumph turning to ashes in his mouth. He tried to interject, to assert his “rights,” to remind them of his lineage, but MotherGoose merely fixed him with a gaze that silenced him more effectively than any gag, a gaze that promised a particularly unpleasant fate if he dared to interrupt again.

Finally, Elder Thorne, his voice strained, his face pale, conceded. “The… the annulment… it will be suspended. The betrothal to Kael… nullified. For now.” The words hung in the air, a fragile victory, a temporary reprieve. MotherGoose had won. But as she led a dazed, hopeful Ana from the chambers, Kael’s eyes, burning with a silent, chilling fury, promised that this was far from over. The village might bend, but Kael would not break. And the path ahead, Ana knew, was still fraught with peril. But for the first time in a long time, she felt a glimmer of hope. And a fierce determination to fight for her future, for David, and for the true meaning of freedom, a freedom that tasted of wild berries and defiant honks.

## Chapter Ending

The Elders, their faces grim, their authority momentarily shattered, conceded. The annulment, for now, was suspended, the betrothal to Kael nullified. A fragile victory, a temporary reprieve. But as MotherGoose led a dazed, hopeful Ana from the chambers, her heart soaring with a fragile hope, Kael’s eyes, burning with a silent, chilling fury, promised that this was far from over. The village might bend, but Kael would not break. Ana, her heart soaring with a fragile hope, knew the fight was far from over. But with MotherGoose by her side, a feathered beacon of ancient wisdom, and the memory of David’s love burning bright, she was ready. The path ahead was uncertain, fraught with peril, but for the first time, she faced it not with despair, but with a fierce, unyielding resolve. The true battle for freedom had just begun, and Ana, with her goose feather Calling, was ready to lead the charge, one witty retort and one defiant honk at a time.
