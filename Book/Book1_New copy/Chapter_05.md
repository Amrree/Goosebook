# Chapter 5

## Scene 1: A Morning with Elder Goose

David’s morning began, as it often did, with a philosophical debate that would have left Master Grimshaw’s tortoise, Chronos, in a state of existential crisis. Not with a sage, or a scholar, or even a particularly opinionated villager, but with a goose. Elder Goose, to be precise, who was currently perched regally on David’s windowsill, his beady black eyes fixed on the horizon with an intensity usually reserved for predicting the end of the world, or perhaps, the arrival of a particularly juicy worm. His honks, a series of low, rumbling pronouncements, seemed to convey a profound dissatisfaction with the dew point, which, according to his feathered wisdom, was entirely too high for optimal foraging conditions.

“Too humid, is it, old friend?” David mumbled, rubbing the sleep from his eyes, a faint smile playing on his lips. He didn’t speak Goose, not in the way the Called did, not with the formal, ritualistic pronouncements of the village elders, but after a lifetime together, he was fluent in Elder Goose’s particular brand of feathered meteorological commentary. The goose let out a sharp, indignant honk, then nudged a wilting daisy in a cracked pot with his beak, as if to say, *See? Even the flora despairs! This is a clear sign of impending atmospheric malaise! Your wisdom knows no bounds, Goose, but your ability to predict the weather is truly unparalleled.* “Ah, yes, the wilting daisy. A clear sign of impending atmospheric malaise. Your wisdom knows no bounds, Goose, though I suspect the daisy might disagree with your assessment of its existential dread.”

Elder Goose, apparently satisfied with David’s comprehension, hopped down with a dignified waddle, then proceeded to meticulously preen a single, pristine white feather, as if preparing for a particularly important avian fashion show, or perhaps, a very exclusive goose-only poetry slam. His peculiar habits were a constant source of amusement and, occasionally, profound insight. David had learned more about the subtle shifts of the seasons, the best foraging spots for wild berries, and the inherent folly of human ambition from Elder Goose than from any of the village’s more conventional sources of wisdom. The goose, for instance, had once spent an entire afternoon attempting to teach a particularly dense squirrel the intricacies of nut-burying, a futile endeavor that David had found far more enlightening than Master Grimshaw’s lectures on the Glorious Lineage of Millbrook, which mostly involved memorizing the names of long-dead Mayors and the precise dates of particularly uninteresting harvests.

David’s internal monologue often revolved around the unconventional wisdom he gained from his feathered companion. While the villagers chased after prestigious Callings and societal approval, meticulously planning their lives according to ancient traditions and rigid expectations, Elder Goose chased after particularly plump beetles and the perfect sunbeam for napping. And in his simple, unburdened existence, there was a profound truth that often eluded the more “civilized” inhabitants of Millbrook. The goose, for all his eccentricities, for all his dramatic pronouncements about the weather, was truly free. He lived by his own rules, answered to no one, and found joy in the simplest of things. And David, watching him, felt a quiet yearning for that same unburdened existence, a life where his worth wasn’t measured by his lineage or his Calling, but by the quiet contentment of his own soul.

He prepared a simple breakfast of stale bread and wild berries, sharing a portion with Elder Goose, who accepted it with a regal nod, as if David were merely a particularly efficient, two-legged servant. The cottage, small and ramshackle, was a haven of quiet contemplation, a stark contrast to the bustling, judgmental world of the village. Here, David was simply David, and Elder Goose was simply Elder Goose, and their philosophical debates about dew points and existential dread were the most profound conversations he had all day. It was a life of quiet contentment, a life he cherished, and a life he was determined to protect, especially now that Ana was a part of it.

## Scene 2: Grandparent’s Peculiar Wisdom

Later that morning, David found his grandparent, Hanna, in her small, cluttered garden, a riot of unusual herbs and suspiciously sentient-looking plants. Hanna, a delightful mix of ancient wisdom and whimsical eccentricity, was humming a tuneless melody that sounded suspiciously like a lullaby for a particularly stubborn turnip, as she meticulously pruned a patch of glowing moss. Her Calling, MotherGoose, was nowhere in sight, probably off somewhere contemplating the existential dread of a particularly stubborn turnip, or perhaps, engaging in a clandestine meeting with a particularly opinionated earthworm. Hanna, however, seemed perfectly content in her solitude, her gnarled hands moving with a practiced grace among the herbs, each movement a testament to years of tending to the village’s ailments and, more often, its absurdities.

“Ah, David, my little sprout,” Hanna chirped, not looking up, her voice like dry leaves rustling in a gentle breeze. “Just in time. The moonwort is particularly chatty today. It says the village elders are planning a new tax on laughter. Apparently, joy is a finite resource that must be carefully managed, like a particularly rare and elusive truffle. And that Barnaby’s sheep are secretly plotting a wool-based revolution.”

Hanna’s conversations were always like this: a delightful labyrinth of riddles, folk tales, and practical advice that often seemed nonsensical at first but held profound truth, like a particularly thorny rose with a surprisingly sweet scent. She was the village’s ancient herbalist, but her true calling, David suspected, was to subtly unravel the rigid tapestry of Millbrook’s traditions, one cryptic pronouncement at a time. She saw the world not as a series of rigid rules, but as a living, breathing entity, full of hidden pathways and unexpected wisdom, a place where even a wilting daisy could hold a profound philosophical truth.

“A tax on laughter?” David repeated, a smile playing on his lips, a genuine, unburdened smile that rarely made an appearance in the village proper. “That sounds about right. They’d probably exempt Barnaby, though. His laughter is mostly sheep-related, and therefore, probably considered an agricultural necessity.”

Hanna chuckled, a sound like dry leaves skittering across stone, a sound that always made David feel a profound sense of peace. “Indeed. But true joy, David, is like a wild river. You can try to dam it, to control its flow, to channel it into neat, predictable streams, but it will always find a way. It will always carve its own path, even if it means overflowing its banks and causing a delightful amount of chaos.” She glanced at him, her eyes twinkling with a mischievous glint. “Just like some young rivers I know. And some particularly stubborn geese.”

David, ever the patient listener, had learned to piece together the wisdom from Hanna’s seemingly random pronouncements. Her teachings, combined with Elder Goose’s influence, had shaped his worldview, making him question the rigid rules of the village, making him yearn for something more, something wilder, something truer. He watched her now, her gnarled hands moving with a practiced grace among the herbs, a living embodiment of the wildness she preached. She was a beacon of freedom in a village that valued conformity above all else, a quiet rebel in a world that demanded absolute obedience. She was, in essence, everything the Elders feared.

“The Solstice is coming, Hanna,” David said, his voice low, the unspoken weight of the impending ceremony hanging heavy in the air. “Everyone’s talking about their Callings. About their destiny. About the future that has been chosen for them.”

Hanna sighed, a sound like the wind through ancient trees, a sigh that carried the weight of centuries of observation. “Destiny, my dear, is a path you walk, not a cage you’re born into. The Callings… they are merely signposts. Some choose to follow them blindly, like particularly obedient sheep. Others… others choose to carve their own way, to forge a new path, even if it means venturing into the unknown. And sometimes,” she added, a mischievous glint in her eye, a hint of the ancient magic that flowed through her veins, “the most interesting paths are the ones that lead far, far away from the well-trodden road, into a world where the only rules are the ones you make for yourself. A world where a goose feather can be a symbol of defiance, not disgrace.”

## Scene 3: Ana’s Visit and a Shared Secret

Ana’s arrival at David’s secluded cottage was, as always, a breath of fresh air, a vibrant splash of color in his quiet world, like a particularly flamboyant butterfly landing on a very sensible rock. She navigated the overgrown path with a grace that belied her refined upbringing, her eyes wide with curiosity and a hint of amusement, as if she were embarking on a particularly intriguing anthropological expedition. Elder Goose, who had been napping in a particularly sunny spot, woke with a startled honk, then proceeded to eye Ana with a mixture of suspicion and grudging admiration, as if assessing her potential for mischief, or perhaps, her ability to provide particularly plump beetles.

“He’s assessing your potential for mischief,” David explained, a smile playing on his lips, a smile that always seemed to reach his kind eyes. “He’s usually quite accurate. Though I suspect he’s also wondering if you brought any snacks.”

Ana laughed, a sound like wind chimes in a gentle breeze, a sound that always made David’s heart do a little jig. “Well, I certainly hope I pass the goose test. Though I must confess, my pockets are currently devoid of plump beetles. Your grandparent, I presume?” she asked, nodding towards Hanna, who was now attempting to coax a particularly stubborn mushroom into singing a lullaby, a task that seemed to be met with considerable resistance from the fungal community.

Ana, with her characteristic wit and charm, quickly adapted to David’s unique world, a world so different from her own carefully curated existence. She engaged with Elder Goose, offering him a particularly plump berry that he accepted with a dignified nod, as if she had just presented him with a diplomatic treaty. She listened, fascinated, as Hanna spoke of the moonwort’s gossip and the secret language of the trees, her mind, usually so analytical, open to the whimsical wisdom of the natural world. There was a warmth here, a sense of belonging, that Ana rarely experienced in her own grand, yet suffocating, home. Here, she wasn’t the Mayor’s daughter; she was simply Ana, a curious, intelligent young woman seeking truth and connection.

As the afternoon wore on, they shared a simple meal of fresh bread, wild berries, and Hanna’s surprisingly potent herbal tea, which tasted faintly of sunshine and rebellion. The conversation flowed easily, a comfortable rhythm of shared laughter and quiet understanding, punctuated by Elder Goose’s occasional, insightful honks. Hanna, with a knowing look that seemed to pierce through Ana’s carefully constructed facade, suddenly turned to them, her eyes twinkling with ancient wisdom. “The Solstice,” she mused, her voice soft, yet resonant, “is a time of choosing. A time when the veil between worlds is thin. And sometimes, the bravest choices are made not in the light of day, but in the quiet whispers of the heart. Especially when those whispers involve a particularly handsome young man and a very opinionated goose.” She paused, her gaze lingering on their clasped hands, a silent acknowledgment of their shared secret. “Some paths, my dears, are meant to be walked together. Even if they lead far, far away from what is expected. Even if they lead into the wild, untamed heart of freedom.”

David and Ana exchanged a significant glance, a silent reaffirmation of their shared secret, their desperate plan. Hanna’s words, cryptic yet profound, were a blessing, a subtle nudge towards the freedom they so desperately craved. The cottage, with its warmth and its unconventional wisdom, felt like a true sanctuary, a place where their love, and their dreams, could finally take root. They were a partnership, capable of navigating both the whimsical and the serious aspects of their lives together, ready to face the unknown, ready to carve their own path, guided by the wisdom of a wise old woman and a very opinionated goose.

## Chapter Ending

As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, casting long, playful shadows across the fields, Ana and David walked hand-in-hand, a small, intricately carved wooden goose clutched in Ana’s palm, a gift from Hanna, a tangible reminder of the unconventional wisdom they had found. The village, with its rigid rules and peculiar pedagogues, felt a world away, a distant memory fading with the encroaching darkness. Here, by the whispering water, their dreams felt real, tangible, a vibrant tapestry woven from shared hopes and quiet defiance. And as they walked back, separate paths but shared purpose, a silent promise hung in the air: they would find their freedom. Together. The Solstice was coming, and with it, their last chance to choose their own destiny. And this time, they would seize it, with the blessing of a wise old woman, the guidance of a very opinionated goose, and the unwavering strength of their shared love. The road ahead was uncertain, but for the first time, they faced it not with fear, but with a fierce, unyielding resolve, ready to embrace the wild, untamed heart of freedom.
