# Chapter 3

## Scene 1: Lessons in Conformity

The village schoolhouse, a squat, stone building with windows so narrow they seemed designed to keep out both sunlight and rebellious thoughts, felt less like a place of vibrant learning and more like a particularly well-organized holding pen for young minds. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old parchment, nervous anticipation, and the faint, lingering aroma of yesterday’s chalk dust, a scent that, to Ana, always smelled faintly of crushed dreams. Ana, seated at her meticulously arranged desk, felt the familiar weight of conformity settle upon her shoulders like a particularly itchy wool blanket, woven from the threads of expectation and societal pressure. Every creak of the floorboards, every rustle of a classmate’s tunic, every precisely timed clearing of a teacher’s throat, seemed to whisper: *conform, conform, conform. Or else.* Ana often wondered what the “or else” entailed. Probably more porridge.

At the front of the classroom, perched on a stool that seemed far too small for his imposing frame, sat Master Grimshaw, the history teacher. His face was a study in stern angles, his spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose like a tiny, judgmental bird. His lectures on “The Glorious Lineage of Millbrook” could cure insomnia faster than a triple dose of nightshade, and were delivered in a monotone that rivaled the droning of a particularly bored bee. He spoke of ancient treaties and forgotten battles with the enthusiasm of a man reading a laundry list, his voice punctuated only by the occasional, dramatic pause for effect, during which Ana often found herself mentally composing grocery lists, or, on particularly dull days, contemplating the philosophical implications of lint. His Calling, a stoic, unblinking tortoise named ‘Chronos,’ sat motionless on his desk, occasionally emitting a slow, deliberate blink that seemed to convey profound boredom, or perhaps, a deep, existential weariness with the repetitive nature of human history.

“And so,” Master Grimshaw intoned, his voice a dry rustle like ancient scrolls crumbling into dust, “we see that the very fabric of our society is woven from the threads of tradition, passed down through generations, unbroken, unblemished, and utterly uninteresting.” Chronos blinked. Ana stifled a yawn, her internal monologue already composing a scathing critique of his pedagogical methods. *Unblemished, perhaps, but certainly not uninteresting to those who actually lived it,* she thought, her mind already wandering to the more vibrant, less sanctioned histories she’d gleaned from Hanna’s cryptic tales, tales of rebellious ancestors and daring escapes that Master Grimshaw would undoubtedly deem “unsuitable for public consumption.”

Then there was Miss Primrose, the etiquette instructor, a woman whose every gesture was a lesson in rigid posture and stifled laughter. Her smile was a thin, precise line, as if drawn with a ruler, and her voice, though soft, had the cutting edge of a freshly sharpened knife, capable of dissecting a social faux pas with surgical precision. Her Calling, a tiny, meticulously preened canary, chirped on her shoulder, its every note as perfectly modulated as Miss Primrose’s own pronouncements. Ana suspected the canary had been trained to sing only in perfect fifths, and probably had a very strict diet of organic birdseed and disapproving glances.

“A lady,” Miss Primrose would declare, demonstrating a posture so stiff Ana worried her spine might snap, “must always maintain an air of… refined composure. Even when faced with the most… uncouth of circumstances. One must never, for instance, allow one’s emotions to… *spill*.” Ana’s internal commentary, a running stream of witty observations about the absurdity of the lessons, was her only solace. *Uncouth circumstances, like being forced to marry a pompous brute with a wolf Calling? Or perhaps, a goose feather for a Calling? I wonder if Miss Primrose has a lesson on how to gracefully accept a feathered destiny.* She imagined Miss Primrose attempting to curtsy to a particularly aggressive badger, and a small, rebellious giggle threatened to escape.

Ana, outwardly compliant, would nod, feign interest, and occasionally offer a perfectly phrased, utterly meaningless question that would send Miss Primrose into raptures of approval. “Miss Primrose, is it true that the proper way to hold a teacup reflects the purity of one’s intentions?” she’d ask, her eyes wide with feigned innocence. Miss Primrose would beam, launching into a twenty-minute dissertation on the spiritual significance of porcelain. But inside, her mind was a whirlwind of rebellion, dissecting the absurdity of the lessons, finding humor in the teachers’ unwavering dedication to dullness. She was learning, certainly, but not what they intended. She was learning how to navigate a world that demanded conformity, while secretly plotting her escape, a mental map of freedom forming in the quiet corners of her mind.

## Scene 2: David’s Unconventional Education

While Ana was being meticulously molded into a proper village lady, a process that involved an alarming amount of posture correction and polite nodding, David was receiving an education of a different sort, one taught by the whispering wind, the rustling leaves, and the surprisingly profound wisdom of a particularly stubborn goose. His classroom was the sprawling fields, the whispering woods, and the winding river that snaked its way through the village outskirts. Here, the lessons were not about lineage or etiquette, but about survival, observation, and the intricate dance of the natural world, a dance that often involved Elder Goose attempting to outsmart a particularly cunning squirrel.

Elder Goose, his feathered mentor, was a constant companion, a feathered shadow with an opinion on everything from the optimal angle for sunbathing to the philosophical implications of a particularly juicy worm. He’d nudge David’s hand with his beak, guiding him to a patch of particularly potent herbs, or honk indignantly at a poorly tied knot, as if the knot’s sloppiness was a personal affront to his avian sensibilities. David didn’t speak Goose, not in the way the Called did, but after a lifetime together, he was fluent in Elder Goose’s brand of feathered wisdom, a language of honks, nudges, and surprisingly expressive eye-rolls. The old bird, despite being a goose, seemed to possess more common sense than most of the village elders, and certainly more than Master Grimshaw, who once spent an entire afternoon trying to explain the concept of “linear time” to a particularly bewildered group of students.

One afternoon, as David was attempting to mend a broken fence post, a task that involved more splinters than actual progress, Elder Goose waddled over, a particularly plump beetle clutched in his beak. He dropped it at David’s feet, then honked, a series of sharp, staccato sounds, punctuated by a triumphant flap of his wings. “You think I should use a different kind of wood?” David mused, examining the beetle, which seemed to be contemplating its imminent demise with a stoic resignation. Elder Goose honked again, more emphatically, then nudged the beetle with his beak, as if to say, *No, you imbecile, the beetle knows something about wood rot! Listen to the beetle!* “Ah, you mean the beetle knows something about wood rot? You’re a genius, Goose. A feathered, six-legged genius. Though I’m not entirely sure how to apply beetle wisdom to fence mending.”

David’s quiet observations of the world were a stark contrast to the rote memorization happening inside the schoolhouse. He knew the subtle shift in the wind that foretold a coming storm, the particular call of a rare bird that signaled a change in the season, the hidden pathways through the forest that only the wild creatures knew. He could track a rabbit by the faint imprint of its paws in the dew-kissed grass, identify a plant by the scent of its leaves, and tell the time by the angle of the sun. His education was practical, intuitive, and utterly invaluable, a living, breathing curriculum that unfolded with every sunrise and sunset.

He often thought of Ana, trapped in her lessons of conformity, her mind undoubtedly filled with the proper way to hold a teacup and the historical significance of a particularly dull battle. He wondered if she ever longed for the freedom of the open sky, the quiet wisdom of the wilderness, the unburdened joy of a beetle-honking goose. He hoped she did. Because soon, very soon, he planned to offer it to her, a gift of freedom wrapped in the promise of a shared adventure.

## Scene 3: A Shared Secret and a Glimmer of Hope

The old mill, a crumbling relic at the edge of the village, its broken windows like empty eyes staring into the twilight, had become their sanctuary. After school, under the cloak of twilight, Ana would slip away, her heart hammering with a mix of fear and exhilaration, a delicious cocktail of rebellion. David would be waiting, his presence a comforting anchor in the swirling chaos of her life, a silent promise of understanding. Their secret rendezvous were a brief escape from the suffocating expectations of their daily lives, a stolen slice of freedom, a whispered rebellion against the world that sought to define them.

“You wouldn’t believe what Miss Primrose said today,” Ana began one evening, her voice a hushed giggle, a sound that danced on the cool night air. “She demonstrated the proper way to curtsy to a particularly dull nobleman. Apparently, it involves a precise angle of the knee, a subtle dip of the head, and a smile that conveys both deference and a complete lack of personal opinion. I nearly sprained my ankle trying to achieve the perfect level of polite disinterest.”

David chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners, a warm light in the gathering gloom. “Sounds… thrilling. Elder Goose, however, discovered a new species of mushroom today. He says it tastes like regret and old socks, and that it’s a clear sign of the impending apocalypse. He’s quite the doomsayer, that goose.”

They exchanged “lessons,” a delightful exchange of their vastly different worlds. Ana shared a witty anecdote about Master Grimshaw’s latest historical pronouncement, a tale of a particularly boring battle that somehow managed to be even more tedious in his retelling. David recounted a fascinating observation about a rare bird he’d spotted, its song a melody of pure, unadulterated freedom, a stark contrast to the stifled chirping of Miss Primrose’s canary. They spoke of their frustrations with the village, the rigid rules, the predetermined paths that felt less like destiny and more like a very long, very boring chore list. Ana confessed her longing for knowledge that wasn’t sanctioned by the Elders, for a life where her mind could soar beyond the confines of the schoolhouse, a life where she could ask questions without fear of being labeled “unladylike.” David spoke of his quiet frustration with the village’s narrow-mindedness, his growing desire to protect Ana from its constraints, from the suffocating weight of its expectations.

It was a moment of shared vulnerability, a quiet confession of their deepest desires, their most fervent hopes. And in that shared space, a glimmer of hope began to shine, a tiny spark that threatened to ignite a wildfire of rebellion. “We can’t stay here, David,” Ana whispered, her voice barely audible above the gentle rush of the river, a sound that seemed to echo her own yearning for escape. “Not if we want to truly live. Not if we want to choose our own path. Not if we want to avoid a lifetime of curtsying to dull noblemen and listening to tortoises contemplate the meaning of dust.”

David squeezed her hand, his gaze unwavering, his eyes reflecting the starlight above. “I know. I’ve been thinking… about a way. A way out. Before the Solstice. Before they can force us into Callings we don’t want. Before they can turn us into another set of predictable, well-behaved villagers.” He spoke of hidden paths, of supplies he’d been subtly gathering, of a world beyond the village borders, a world where they could be truly free, a world where a goose feather could be a symbol of defiance, not disgrace. It was a whispered plan, a shared dream, a silent promise to find a way out, together, a promise that felt as solid and as real as the ancient stones of the mill itself.

## Chapter Ending

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the river, painting the water in hues of deep indigo and shimmering silver, Ana and David sat in comfortable silence, their hands brushing, a silent current of understanding passing between them. The village, with its rigid rules and peculiar pedagogues, felt a world away, a distant memory fading with the encroaching darkness. Here, by the whispering water, their dreams felt real, tangible, a vibrant tapestry woven from shared hopes and quiet defiance. And as they walked back, separate paths but shared purpose, a silent promise hung in the air: they would find their freedom. Together. The Solstice was coming, and with it, their last chance to choose their own destiny. And this time, they would seize it, with a reckless abandon and a fierce, unyielding love that promised to set the world on fire. The whispers behind the walls would soon be replaced by the roar of their freedom, a symphony of defiance that would echo through the ages. And somewhere, a very opinionated goose would honk in approval, perhaps even composing a particularly witty limerick about the folly of human conformity.
