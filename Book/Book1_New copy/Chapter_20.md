# Chapter 20

## Scene 1: The Escape Attempt

Kael’s estate, usually a bastion of quiet, military precision, was now a hive of frantic activity, a veritable beehive of nervous energy and last-minute preparations. The Solstice, that fateful day, had dawned, painting the sky in hues of desperate orange and ominous purple, a grim prophecy of the chaos to come. Ana, confined to her chambers, felt the urgency thrumming in her veins, a frantic drumbeat against the gilded bars of her prison, each beat a painful reminder of the ticking clock. The wedding, Kael’s ultimate triumph, his final act of possession, was set for sundown, a grim counterpoint to the sacred ritual of the Portal. Time, that fickle mistress, was running out, slipping through her fingers like grains of sand.

She had spent the last few days meticulously mapping her escape, every creak of the floorboards, every shift change of the guards, every subtle draft from a hidden passage, etched into her mind with the precision of a master cartographer. Her mind, sharp and cunning, was a blueprint of freedom, a labyrinth of escape routes and contingency plans. The hidden seam in the cold stone wall, a faint, almost imperceptible line, was her only hope, a tiny crack in the seemingly impenetrable fortress of Kael’s control. She worked with a desperate urgency, her fingers raw, her breath coming in ragged gasps, each movement a silent prayer for freedom. The guards, lulled by her outward compliance, by her demure smiles and her seemingly resigned demeanor, were oblivious to the quiet rebellion unfolding within her chambers, a rebellion fueled by love and a fierce, unyielding will.

Her first attempt involved a particularly elaborate feigned fainting spell, designed to draw the guards away from her door, a classic maneuver she had perfected during her childhood to avoid particularly tedious etiquette lessons. It worked, briefly, sending the guards into a flurry of panicked whispers and frantic calls for smelling salts. But Kael, with his uncanny knack for ruining perfectly good plans, appeared as if from thin air, his eyes narrowed, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, sniffing suspiciously at her prone form, its nose twitching with a canine skepticism. “Playing games, my dear?” he purred, his voice a silken threat, dripping with a false concern that made her stomach churn. “Such a waste of your considerable talents. Save your theatrics for our wedding night. I assure you, the audience will be far more appreciative.” Ana merely offered a weak, demure smile, her internal monologue composing a particularly gruesome fate for him, involving a very large badger and a very small, very sharp spoon.

But Ana was nothing if not resourceful. Her next attempt involved a sympathetic servant, a young girl named Elara, whose eyes held a flicker of defiance, a quiet yearning for something more than a life of servitude. Ana had, over the past few days, subtly cultivated a connection with Elara, sharing whispered stories of freedom, of a world beyond Kael’s oppressive grasp, of a life where goose feathers were symbols of defiance, not disgrace. Elara, with a courage that belied her timid nature, agreed to create a diversion. A spilled tray of hot tea, a conveniently “accidental” collision with a patrolling guard, a particularly loud and dramatic sneeze – small acts of rebellion, but enough to buy Ana precious moments, a sliver of time in which to make her escape.

As the commotion erupted in the corridor, a symphony of shouts, curses, and the clatter of falling teacups, Ana slipped through the hidden passage, her heart hammering against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat of anticipation. The passage was dark, dusty, and smelled faintly of forgotten secrets and the occasional, very old, mouse. She moved with a silent grace, her senses heightened, every rustle, every distant shout, every creak of the ancient timbers, a potential threat. She was free, for now, but the estate was a labyrinth, and Kael’s men were everywhere, their heavy footsteps echoing through the stone corridors. A tense chase ensued, a desperate dance through the shadows, her breath catching in her throat as she heard the shouts of her pursuers growing closer, their voices like the baying of hounds. She was a mouse in a lion’s den, but this mouse, she vowed, would not be caught. Not today. Not ever.

## Scene 2: David's Arrival and the Confrontation

David, guided by a desperate hope and a cryptic message from MotherGoose (delivered via a particularly agitated pigeon who seemed to have a penchant for dramatic entrances), arrived near the Solstice Portal just as the first stars began to prick the twilight sky, their distant light a beacon of hope in the encroaching darkness. He had escaped his own captivity, his body aching, his muscles screaming in protest, his mind a whirlwind of fear and determination. He knew Kael’s plan, the ritual, the binding. He knew he had to stop it. But he was alone, and Kael’s forces were formidable, a dark, menacing presence in the fading light.

Then, he saw her. A flash of ivory against the deepening gloom, a beacon of defiance, running through the trees, her gown torn, her hair wild, her face streaked with dirt and determination. Ana. And behind her, the baying of Kael’s hounds, the shouts of his men, a relentless pursuit that threatened to consume her. “Ana!” he roared, his voice raw with relief and terror, a primal sound that echoed through the forest. He burst from the treeline, a lone figure against the encroaching darkness, his heart soaring at the sight of her, even as despair threatened to consume him. He was here. He had found her. And he would not let them take her again.

Ana, hearing his voice, a sound that felt like a lifeline in the swirling chaos, turned, her eyes wide with shock and a desperate hope. “David!” She launched herself into his arms, a brief, desperate reunion amidst the chaos, their bodies colliding, their hands clasped, a silent understanding passing between them. They were together. And they would face this, together. Kael’s men, surprised by David’s sudden appearance, hesitated, their pursuit momentarily faltering, their faces a mixture of confusion and annoyance. But Kael, his face contorted with rage, his eyes blazing with a furious intensity, quickly rallied them. “There! The orphan! Get them both! Do not let them reach the Portal! Do not let them ruin my triumph!”

The forest floor became a battlefield, the air thick with the clash of steel, the shouts of men, and the snarls of Kael’s Wolf Calling, Shadow. David fought with a ferocity born of desperation, protecting Ana, his movements fluid and precise, each blow a testament to his unwavering love. Ana, despite her fear, fought beside him, her wits her weapon, her movements surprisingly agile, dodging blows, distracting guards, her mind a whirlwind of tactical brilliance. They were outnumbered, outmatched, but their combined resolve was a force to be reckoned with, a silent, unyielding defiance against the tyranny that sought to crush them. They were fighting not just for their lives, but for their freedom, for their love, for a future that refused to be dictated by tradition or tyranny, a future they would carve out for themselves, with their own hands, with their own choices.

## Scene 3: The Solstice Portal Ritual

The Solstice Portal loomed before them, a swirling vortex of shimmering light and ancient magic, its ethereal glow illuminating the clearing, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe with a life of their own. It pulsed with an ancient energy, a silent hum that vibrated through the very ground beneath their feet. Kael, his face a mask of triumphant fury, arrived with his remaining forces, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, snarling at his heels, its eyes burning with a predatory satisfaction. “Too late!” he shrieked, his voice echoing through the clearing, a sound of pure, unadulterated malice. “The ritual will be completed! Ana will be bound to me, and my power will be absolute! The village will finally know true order! And you, orphan, will witness your utter defeat!” He began to chant, his voice rising in a guttural crescendo, the air crackling with dark magic, the very trees seeming to recoil from his malevolent presence.

Suddenly, a shadow detached itself from the deeper shadows of the forest, a majestic presence that commanded attention. MotherGoose. She emerged, not with a waddle, but with a majestic stride, her feathers shimmering with an almost blinding luminescence, her eyes burning with an ancient, powerful light, a wisdom that transcended time itself. She was no longer just Hanna’s eccentric Calling; she was a force of nature, a guardian of ancient magic, a protector of true love, a feathered harbinger of chaos and justice. “Silence, fool!” she honked, her voice resonating with a power that made the very ground tremble, sending shivers down Kael’s spine. “You desecrate this sacred place! You twist the ancient rites for your petty ambitions! The Portal does not bind; it reveals! And today, it will reveal your true nature! A nature as twisted and as barren as a winter tree!”

A magical confrontation erupted, a battle of wills between Kael’s dark magic and MotherGoose’s ancient power, a clash of light and shadow that illuminated the clearing in blinding flashes. Shadow, Kael’s Wolf Calling, lunged at MotherGoose, its fangs bared, its eyes burning with a fierce, primal rage. But MotherGoose merely met its charge with a single, powerful honk, a sound that seemed to vibrate through the very air, sending it sprawling, whimpering, at Kael’s feet, its tail drooping in defeat. Kael, enraged, unleashed a torrent of dark energy towards MotherGoose, a black, swirling mass of malevolence, but she met it with a shimmering shield of pure light, her eyes fixed on the Portal, her gaze unwavering.

“Ana!” MotherGoose honked, her voice urgent, cutting through the chaos. “The Portal! It calls to you! Embrace your true Calling! Your destiny is not to be bound, but to be free! Reach for it! Reach for your truth!”

Ana, with David’s unwavering support, stepped forward, her heart pounding, but her resolve firm, her eyes fixed on the swirling light of the Portal. She looked at David, his face grim but determined, his hand clasped tightly in hers, their love a silent promise, a shared strength. Their love, their shared journey, their defiance – it all culminated in this moment. She closed her eyes, focusing on the hum of magic that now resonated within her, a latent power she had only just begun to understand, a power that felt as ancient and as wild as the forest itself. She reached out, not for a shining entity, not for a predetermined destiny, but for the very essence of the Portal, for the freedom it represented, for the love that fueled her, for the truth that lay within her own heart.

Kael shrieked, his ritual faltering, his voice a desperate, broken sound, as Ana’s power surged, disrupting his dark magic, activating the Portal in a new, unexpected way. A blinding light erupted from the Portal, engulfing Kael and his men, a wave of pure, unadulterated magic that stripped them of their power, their arrogance, their very will. Kael, his face contorted in a silent scream, crumpled to the ground, his power shattered, his triumph turned to dust, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, whimpering beside him, a broken reflection of its broken master.

## Chapter Ending

As the Solstice sun broke through the trees, bathing the Portal in golden light, a new dawn breaking over Millbrook, Kael lay defeated, his power shattered, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, whimpering at his side, a pathetic shadow of its former self. Ana, hand in hand with David, felt a new strength surge within her, a hum of magic she now understood, a power that resonated with the very essence of the Portal, a power that promised a future of endless possibilities. MotherGoose, her eyes twinkling with ancient knowledge, simply smiled, a knowing, cryptic expression, a silent acknowledgment of the battle won. “This is but the first step, little goose,” she whispered, her voice echoing in Ana’s mind, a gentle breeze carrying her words across the clearing. “The road ahead is long, and the world is far larger than you know. Your true Calling, Ana, is not a destination, but a journey. A journey of freedom, of love, of discovery. A journey that will take you far beyond the confines of this village, far beyond the expectations of others.” And with that, she vanished, leaving Ana and David to face a future both uncertain and full of promise. The village, they knew, would react. Kael, though defeated, would not be forgotten. But for now, they were together, their love a beacon against the lingering darkness, their path illuminated by the unwavering light of their shared commitment. The Calling Storm had passed, but the adventure, they knew, had only just begun. And somewhere, a very opinionated goose was probably already planning their next grand adventure, perhaps involving a particularly stubborn dragon and a very large, very comfortable armchair.
