# Chapter 18

## Scene 1: Preparations for the Betrothal

Ana’s home, once a place of quiet contemplation and whispered secrets, had become a whirlwind of silks, lace, and suffocating expectation. The forced betrothal to Kael was not merely a legal decree; it was a public spectacle, a meticulously orchestrated performance designed to break her spirit and assert the village’s absolute control, a grim parody of a joyous occasion. Every morning, a gaggle of seamstresses, their needles flying like agitated bees, descended upon her, their whispers a constant hum of gossip and pity, punctuated by the occasional, dramatic sigh. “Such a shame, dear. But Kael is a fine match. So strong. So… determined. And his family has such a lovely Wolf Calling.”

Ana endured the fittings with a stoic grace that belied the maelstrom within. The wedding gown, a confection of ivory lace and shimmering pearls, felt less like a garment and more like a shroud, each stitch a tiny, suffocating reminder of her predetermined fate. She would stand motionless, her eyes fixed on some distant point, perhaps contemplating the philosophical implications of a particularly stubborn thread, while her internal monologue composed scathing critiques of the fabric choices and the seamstresses’ questionable taste. “This lace,” she’d think, “is clearly designed to trap, not adorn. And these pearls? They feel suspiciously like tiny, judgmental eyes, silently condemning my lack of enthusiasm.” She even considered, for a fleeting moment, suggesting a more practical, mud-resistant fabric, but decided against it. Some battles were not worth fighting.

Lessons on wifely duties followed, delivered by a stern-faced matron whose own Calling, a particularly docile sheep, seemed to embody the very essence of passive obedience. “A wife’s duty,” the matron would drone, her voice as flat and uninspiring as stale bread, “is to serve, to obey, to anticipate her husband’s every need. And to ensure his socks are always neatly folded. A well-folded sock, dear, is the cornerstone of a happy marriage.” Ana would nod, her expression demure, while secretly planning subtle acts of sabotage. A misplaced embroidery needle here, a mysteriously tangled skein of yarn there, a particularly aggressive beetle introduced into the matron’s tea. Small, insignificant acts of rebellion, perhaps, but they were hers, tiny sparks of defiance in a world that demanded absolute conformity.

Kael’s visits were the worst. He would arrive with a flourish, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, pacing possessively at his heels, its eyes gleaming with a predatory satisfaction. He would bring her gifts – glittering jewels, exotic perfumes, a particularly aggressive badger he’d caught in the woods – each one a gilded chain designed to bind her, to remind her of his ownership. “Soon, Ana,” he’d purr, his voice a silken threat, dripping with a false concern that made her skin crawl, “you will be mine. Truly mine. And then, all this… defiance… will cease. You will learn to appreciate the finer things in life. Like obedience. And silence. And the subtle art of badger-wrangling.” He would try to assert his claim, his hand brushing her arm, his gaze lingering, a possessive touch that made her skin crawl. Ana would flinch, her body recoiling, but her eyes would meet his, cold and unwavering. Her silence was her shield, her defiance a quiet fire that burned brighter with every attempt he made to extinguish it. He thought he was breaking her. He was only hardening her resolve, forging her into a weapon he could never control.

## Scene 2: The Betrothal Ceremony

The village square, once again, was transformed. This time, for the formalization of Ana’s forced union with Kael, a grim parody of a joyous occasion. Banners, emblazoned with Kael’s family crest, a snarling wolf, fluttered from every post, proclaiming his triumph, his absolute dominion. The air was thick with the scent of celebratory incense, the cloying sweetness of forced joy, and the nervous chatter of the villagers, their voices a low hum of gossip and apprehension. Ana, dressed in the oppressive ivory gown, felt like a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter, each step a painful reminder of her lost freedom. She walked beside her father, his hand a heavy weight on her arm, his face beaming with a pride that felt utterly alien, a pride born of political maneuvering and shattered dreams.

Kael stood at the altar, a smug, triumphant smirk on his face, his Wolf Calling, Shadow, a dark, imposing presence beside him, its eyes gleaming with a predatory satisfaction. He looked every inch the victorious warrior, the rightful heir, the man who had brought order back to the village, a self-proclaimed hero in a story of his own making. The Elders, their faces radiating self-satisfaction, presided over the ceremony, their voices a monotonous drone of ancient vows and legalistic pronouncements, each word a hammer blow against Ana’s already bruised spirit. Ana’s mind drifted, her thoughts a defiant counterpoint to the solemn words. *I do not. I will not. This is not my choice. This is a farce. A cruel, elaborate farce.* She kept her gaze fixed on a distant point, her expression stoic, a subtle gesture of defiance that only David, were he here, would have understood. She was a statue of rebellion, a silent protest against the tyranny of tradition.

When it came time for the exchange of tokens, Kael presented her with a heavy, ornate ring, its large, glittering stone feeling like a shackle on her finger, a tangible symbol of her captivity. Ana, in turn, offered him a small, intricately carved wooden bird, a gift from Hanna, its wings spread as if in flight, a silent promise of her enduring desire for freedom. It was a subtle, almost imperceptible act of rebellion, a silent vow that she would never truly belong to him. Kael, oblivious to the symbolism, merely accepted it with a triumphant grin, believing it to be a sign of her submission, another trophy in his collection. The villagers, some celebrating with genuine enthusiasm, others with an uneasy silence, watched the proceedings, their reactions a mixed tapestry of approval and apprehension. The forced union was complete. But the battle, Ana knew, was far from over. It had only just begun.

## Scene 3: Kael's Estate / Ana's New Prison

Kael’s estate was less a home and more a fortress, its high walls and imposing gates a stark reminder of Ana’s new, more restrictive captivity. Her chambers, though lavishly appointed with silks and tapestries, felt like a gilded cage, each luxurious detail a mocking reminder of her lost freedom. Every window was barred, every door locked, and Kael’s men, silent and watchful, patrolled the corridors, their heavy footsteps echoing through the once-grand halls, a constant reminder of her lack of privacy. She was a prisoner, albeit a very well-dressed one, a trophy wife in a very expensive prison.

Kael’s possessiveness escalated, his attempts to assert his marital rights becoming increasingly desperate, his frustration growing with every subtle act of defiance. He would spend hours in her chambers, speaking of their future, of the children they would have, of the power they would wield together, his words a suffocating blanket of control. His presence was a constant violation, a relentless assault on her spirit. He tried to break her spirit, to force her to acknowledge his claim, to make her surrender, but Ana remained a fortress of quiet resistance. She would answer his questions with polite, evasive answers, her eyes betraying nothing. She would endure his touch with a stillness that spoke volumes of her revulsion, her body a silent protest against his unwanted advances.

But even in her new prison, Ana’s cunning mind was at work. She observed, she listened, she planned. She noticed the subtle shift changes of the guards, the faint creak of a loose floorboard in the corridor, the precise timing of Kael’s nightly patrols, the hidden nooks and crannies of the sprawling estate. She began to leave small, almost imperceptible marks – a loose thread on a tapestry, a misplaced book on a shelf, a single, white goose feather tucked into a hidden corner – hoping that David, if he were still alive, if he were still searching, would understand. Her desperation grew with each passing day, the pressure to escape before the marriage was fully consummated a constant, burning urgency, a relentless ticking clock. She was trapped, yes, but she was not defeated. Not yet. The wedding was set for the next full moon. And time, she knew, was running out. She would find a way. She had to. For David. For freedom. For herself. And for every single person in Millbrook who had ever been crushed by the weight of tradition. The battle, she knew, was far from over. It had only just begun.

## Chapter Ending

The wedding was set for the next full moon. As Kael’s heavy footsteps receded down the hall, the click of the lock echoing like a final, damning pronouncement, Ana ran her hand along the cold stone wall of her new chamber, her fingers brushing against a faint, almost imperceptible seam. A hidden door? Or just a trick of the light? Either way, time was running out. Her heart hammered with a desperate hope, a fierce resolve. She would not be Kael’s wife. She would not be broken. She would find a way. She had to. For David. For freedom. For herself. And for every single person in Millbrook who had ever been crushed by the weight of tradition. The battle, she knew, was far from over. It had only just begun. And somewhere, a very opinionated goose was probably plotting Kael’s demise, one strategically placed honk at a time, a feathered harbinger of chaos and justice.
