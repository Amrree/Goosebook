# Chapter 4

## Scene 1: The Agricultural Calling - A Day in the Fields

The sun, a particularly enthusiastic golden orb, was barely peeking over the horizon when Ana found herself, much to her internal chagrin, knee-deep in mud. The village fields, usually a picturesque backdrop to her more refined contemplations, were, in the harsh light of dawn, a muddy, fragrant testament to the realities of an Agricultural Calling. She was, ostensibly, “helping” with the harvest, which mostly involved her making wry comments about the back-breaking labor and the villagers’ unwavering dedication to dirt, a dedication she found both admirable and utterly baffling.

“One would think,” Ana muttered to David, who, annoyingly, looked perfectly at home amidst the muck, his movements fluid and efficient, “that after centuries of this, someone would invent a self-plowing turnip. Or at least a less… earthy form of sustenance. My hands, I fear, are developing a rather alarming resemblance to a particularly gnarled root vegetable.” She gestured vaguely at a particularly stubborn patch of potatoes, which seemed to be clinging to the earth with the tenacity of a particularly determined barnacle, refusing to yield to her delicate prodding. Her internal monologue was a symphony of complaints: *My gown, a perfectly respectable shade of forest green, is now a rather unfortunate shade of mud brown. And is that… a beetle? On my sleeve?*

Barnaby, however, was in his element. His face, usually a study in quiet earnestness, was alight with a zeal that bordered on the evangelical. He moved among the rows of crops with the reverence of a high priest, passionately explaining the nuances of crop rotation to a bewildered-looking goat Calling named ‘Bartholomew.’ Bartholomew, a creature of simple pleasures, seemed far more interested in nibbling on Barnaby’s tunic than in the complex nitrogen cycle. “You see, little one,” Barnaby cooed, completely oblivious to Ana’s internal eye-rolls and Bartholomew’s blatant disinterest, “the nitrogen fixation is crucial for the next season’s barley. It’s all about symbiosis! A delicate balance! And then, the wool! Oh, the glorious wool!” Bartholomew, unimpressed, merely chewed his cud, a look of profound boredom etched on his whiskered face.

Ana, attempting to dig a potato, managed instead to unearth a rather startled earthworm, which promptly wriggled its way up her arm, causing her to emit a rather unladylike shriek. Then, with a flourish of accidental grace, she accidentally watered a scarecrow with her canteen, drenching its straw hat. “Oh, bother,” she sighed, wiping a smudge of dirt from her cheek, which only succeeded in spreading the mud further. “This is far more complicated than it looks in the harvest festival paintings. They always make it seem so… idyllic. No mention of the mud, or the worms, or the existential dread of a particularly stubborn turnip.”

David, meanwhile, moved with quiet competence, his hands effortlessly handling tasks that made Ana’s muscles ache just watching him. He’d subtly nudge a misplaced hoe into her path, or casually step in front of a particularly aggressive chicken Calling that seemed to have taken a personal vendetta against her ankles. “It’s all about rhythm, Ana,” he said, his voice low and amused, a hint of laughter in his eyes. “And not mistaking a turnip for a potato. Though, to be fair, they do have a similar earthy charm. And a surprising ability to hide.”

Ana shot him a look that could curdle milk. “My charm is considerably less earthy, thank you very much. And my rhythm is more suited to a waltz than a weed-pulling jig. I believe my Calling, whatever it may be, will involve significantly less dirt and significantly more intellectual stimulation.” She sighed, leaning on her hoe, which promptly slipped, sending her teetering precariously into a pile of freshly dug earth. David, with a practiced ease, steadied her, his hand warm on her arm, his eyes twinkling with suppressed mirth. “Perhaps,” he murmured, his lips brushing her ear, “your Calling will be a particularly elegant butterfly. One that avoids all forms of manual labor, and has a very refined taste in nectar.”

“One can only hope,” Ana replied, a genuine smile touching her lips, despite the mud and the agricultural indignities. The sun climbed higher, casting long shadows across the fields, and Ana, despite her initial aversion to the muck, found herself enjoying the quiet camaraderie, the shared amusement, and the surprisingly comforting presence of David’s steady hand. She even managed to dig a few potatoes, though she suspected they were more a testament to David’s subtle guidance than her own burgeoning agricultural skills.

## Scene 2: The Social Calling - The Village Gossip Mill

By midday, the village market square was a vibrant, chaotic tapestry of sights, sounds, and, most importantly, whispers. This was the natural habitat of the Social Calling, where pleasantries were exchanged like currency, subtle digs were delivered with the precision of a master archer, and juicy rumors spread faster than a wildfire in a dry season, fueled by the collective breath of a thousand eager gossips. Ana, navigating the bustling throng with David, felt a familiar thrill of observation. This was her kind of battlefield, a place where words were weapons and reputations were shattered with a single, well-placed insinuation.

“Ah, Mrs. Higgins,” Ana murmured, nodding towards a woman whose every gesture seemed to broadcast information, her very presence a walking, talking newspaper. Mrs. Higgins, the self-proclaimed “Queen of Whispers,” was currently engaged in a rapid-fire exchange with a particularly flustered-looking merchant, her Parrot Calling, perched on her shoulder, mimicking her every inflection, adding a squawking chorus to her pronouncements. “She’s truly a master of her craft. I hear she once spread a rumor about a pig having a secret affair with a turnip, and the pig actually started blushing. And the turnip, I’m told, developed a rather scandalous blush.”

David, who preferred the quiet contemplation of nature to the intricate dance of village gossip, merely offered a polite, if slightly strained, smile. He was clearly uncomfortable with the social scene, his eyes darting around as if expecting a rogue rumor to pounce on him and expose his deepest secrets (which mostly involved a fondness for burnt toast and a secret talent for whistling off-key). But he listened, amused, as Ana dissected the absurdity of social climbing in a village where everyone knew everyone’s business, and then some. “It’s like a particularly aggressive game of ‘I Spy,’ only with reputations at stake,” she whispered, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

“Did you see that?” Ana whispered, as a woman with a Songbird Calling delivered a seemingly innocent compliment that, to Ana’s discerning ear, was laced with enough venom to fell a small horse. “The subtle art of the backhanded compliment. A true Social Calling at work. It’s like a verbal ballet, only with more emotional casualties and significantly less grace.” The Songbird, oblivious, chirped a sweet, innocent melody, a stark contrast to the poison dripping from its owner’s lips.

Mrs. Higgins, her Parrot squawking, suddenly turned her attention to them, her eyes, sharp and inquisitive, like a particularly nosy hawk. “And look who it is! Miss Ana, and young David! Still inseparable, I see. Such a… unique bond. One wonders what kind of Calling would foster such… unconventional closeness.” Her eyes, sharp and inquisitive, lingered on their clasped hands, a subtle dig delivered with the precision of a master. The Parrot squawked, “Unconventional! Unconventional! Scandalous! Scandalous!”

Ana, ever the diplomat, offered a sweet smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “Indeed, Mrs. Higgins. One can only hope our Callings will be as… insightful as yours. And as vocal.” She squeezed David’s hand, a silent message passing between them. His discomfort was palpable, but his amusement at her quick wit was equally clear. The village gossip mill was a powerful force, a relentless engine of speculation and judgment, but Ana, with her sharp mind and even sharper tongue, was learning to navigate its treacherous currents, turning its own weapons against it. She was a master of deflection, a connoisseur of subtle jabs, and a silent rebel in a world that demanded conformity.

## Scene 3: The Burden Calling - A Glimpse of Hardship

As the afternoon wore on, their “learning” excursion took a more somber turn. They found themselves on the village outskirts, near the quarry, a place where the laughter and vibrant colors of the market faded into a muted landscape of dust and toil. Here, the Burden Callings labored, their lives a testament to the village’s less glamorous side, a stark reminder that not all Callings were created equal, and some were, quite frankly, a raw deal. The air was thick with the dust of crushed stone and the quiet grunts of effort, a stark contrast to the cheerful chirping of the Songbird Callings in the market.

They watched a man, his back bent with years of labor, hauling heavy stones from the quarry, his Donkey Calling plodding patiently beside him, its own burden as heavy as its master’s. The donkey, a creature of stoic resignation, seemed to carry the weight of the world on its small, sturdy back. There was no fanfare here, no proud displays, just the rhythmic thud of pickaxes and the quiet grunts of effort. Ana’s initial flippancy, her witty observations, died on her lips. The sheer physical toll, the lack of recognition, the quiet resignation in their eyes – it was a stark contrast to the cheerful farmers and the gossiping socialites. This was the hidden cost of Millbrook’s meticulously ordered society, the silent suffering that allowed others to flourish.

“They say,” David murmured, his voice low, a somber counterpoint to the harsh reality before them, “that a Burden Calling teaches patience. And resilience. But mostly, it teaches you how heavy a stone can be. And how little the world cares.” He walked over to the man, offering him his canteen, its cool water a small act of kindness in a world that offered so little. The man, startled, looked up, his eyes weary but grateful. David, with a quiet respect that needed no words, helped him adjust a strap on his harness, easing the weight on the Donkey Calling’s back. It was a small gesture, but in this place, it felt monumental.

Ana watched him, a lump forming in her throat, a sudden, unexpected ache in her chest. Her privileged upbringing had shielded her from this reality, this quiet, unacknowledged hardship. Her wit, usually her shield, felt inadequate here, a flimsy defense against the raw, unvarnished truth. She saw the raw, unvarnished truth of the village’s social hierarchy, the inherent unfairness of a system that assigned such fates, that condemned some to a lifetime of thankless toil while others basked in the glory of their prestigious Callings. It wasn’t just about a goose feather or a wolf; it was about a life of endless toil, a life without choice, a life where destiny was a burden, not a blessing.

Their shared realization hung heavy in the air, a silent understanding that transcended words. The village, for all its charm and tradition, was built on a foundation of rigid, often cruel, expectations. The Solstice Portal, the grand ceremony that promised destiny, was also a mechanism of control, assigning roles that few could escape. In the quiet strength of David’s compassion, and in her own burgeoning empathy, Ana felt a renewed determination. They couldn’t stay here. Not in a world that assigned such burdens, such fates. Their escape wasn’t just about their love; it was about a fundamental rebellion against a system that denied true freedom, a silent promise to fight for a world where every Calling, every life, held dignity and choice.

## Chapter Ending

As the sun set, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple, casting long, melancholic shadows across the fields, Ana and David walked hand-in-hand, the weight of the village’s expectations pressing down on them like a physical burden. The laughter of the market, the earnestness of Barnaby, the quiet suffering of the Burden Callings – it all coalesced into a single, undeniable truth. But in the quiet strength of their intertwined fingers, a different promise was being forged, one that whispered of freedom, and a future they would choose for themselves. The Solstice was coming, and with it, their last chance. They would seize it, not just for themselves, but for the silent, burdened souls who couldn’t. And as they walked, a single, determined thought echoed between them, a silent vow against the encroaching darkness: *We will not be defined by their Callings. We will define our own path. And perhaps, just perhaps, we’ll find a way to lighten the load for those who carry the heaviest burdens.*
