# Chapter 2

## Scene 1: The Grand Spectacle

The village square, usually a bustling hub of mundane activity – the occasional runaway pig, the weekly market squabble over a particularly bruised apple – had been utterly transformed. Today, it was a riot of color and anticipation, a stage set for the grand spectacle of the Calling Ceremony. Banners, woven with the symbols of the village’s most esteemed Callings (mostly sheep and oxen, naturally, with a surprising lack of anything resembling a goose), fluttered in the breeze like nervous pigeons. Villagers, dressed in their finest, their clothes smelling faintly of lavender and desperation, buzzed with a mix of reverence and rampant gossip, their faces alight with the kind of fervent belief usually reserved for a particularly good harvest or a surprisingly mild winter. The air thrummed with a palpable excitement, a collective holding of breath, punctuated by the occasional nervous cough and the distant bleating of Barnaby’s sheep, which seemed to be practicing their own form of anticipatory anxiety.

Ana, standing beside her father on the elevated platform, felt less like a participant in a sacred rite and more like a prize pig at a county fair, meticulously groomed and displayed for public approval. Her gown, a masterpiece of village finery, felt less like silk and more like a straitjacket, each stitch a tiny, suffocating reminder of her predetermined fate. Her father, Mayor Raines, beamed beside her, his smile a practiced, political thing, radiating paternal pride that felt as genuine as a three-legged cow. He was, no doubt, already calculating the political dividends of his daughter receiving a suitably impressive Calling. Ana’s internal monologue, however, was a delightful stream of sarcastic observations about the absurdity of it all. *If I get a particularly fluffy sheep, will I be expected to knit my own dowry? Or perhaps a particularly judgmental badger, one that will spend its days critiquing my posture?*

Below them, the Elders, looking suitably solemn and important, perched on their own elevated platform, their robes rustling like dry leaves in a storm. They were a collection of the village’s most traditional, most unyielding minds, their faces set in expressions of grave importance, as if the weight of the entire universe rested on their collective, slightly wrinkled shoulders. Ana suspected their Callings were probably all very stern, very sensible, and utterly devoid of anything resembling a sense of humor. Perhaps a particularly rigid badger, or a perpetually disapproving owl, or even a very serious, very bureaucratic earthworm. They were the guardians of tradition, the arbiters of destiny, and, in Ana’s humble opinion, a rather dull lot.

The air thrummed with anticipation, a palpable hum of expectation that vibrated through the very cobblestones. This was the day. The day when the Solstice Portal, a shimmering, ethereal gateway that appeared only once a year, would open. The day when the village’s sixteen-year-olds would step through, to emerge with their animal companion, their Calling, a physical manifestation of their destiny. Ana felt a knot of dread tighten in her stomach, a cold, hard lump of fear and defiance. Her destiny, she knew, was already intertwined with David’s, a destiny that involved a distinct lack of village elders, a healthy dose of open road, and a future she would choose for herself. But first, she had to get through this. She had to play the part. She had to endure the grand spectacle, the pomp and circumstance, the suffocating weight of expectation, all while silently plotting her escape.

## Scene 2: The Unveiling and the Uproar

The first few Callings were, predictably, exactly what the village expected, a meticulously choreographed dance of destiny and tradition. Young Barnaby, his face a mask of earnest hope, his sheep-themed tunic practically vibrating with anticipation, stepped through the shimmering portal. He emerged, beaming, with a small, fluffy lamb nuzzling his leg, its wool already looking suspiciously soft. A collective sigh of satisfaction rippled through the crowd, a sound like a thousand contented sheep. His mother, in the front row, visibly swelled with pride, probably already mentally calculating the yield of wool and the precise dimensions of his future loom. Barnaby, oblivious to the deeper drama, was already whispering sweet nothings to his lamb, probably about the optimal conditions for a particularly robust fleece.

Next was Kael. He strode towards the Portal with a swagger that could curdle milk, his military family’s crest emblazoned proudly on his chest. The air crackled with his arrogance, his certainty. He stepped through the shimmering light, and returned with a magnificent, sleek wolf, its eyes as cold and ambitious as his own. The crowd roared its approval, a deafening wave of adulation. Of course. A military Calling for the military family. How utterly predictable. How utterly *boring*, Ana thought, despite the genuine power radiating from Kael and his new companion. She felt a familiar knot of revulsion tighten in her stomach. He was everything she despised: arrogant, entitled, and utterly convinced of his own superiority.

Then it was Ana’s turn. The air thickened with anticipation, a palpable hum of expectation that felt like a thousand tiny needles pricking at her skin. She took a deep breath, her heart hammering against her ribs, a frantic drumbeat of defiance. She stepped into the shimmering light of the Solstice Portal, the world dissolving into a kaleidoscope of colors, a dizzying swirl of magic and possibility. She reached out, not for a shining entity, not for a predetermined destiny, but for a feeling, a whisper of defiance, a hope for something… unexpected. Something that would shatter their expectations, something that would set her free.

And then, she was back. Standing in the village square, the light of the portal fading behind her, the expectant faces of the villagers staring, their expressions a mixture of curiosity and barely concealed judgment. And there it was. Not a majestic eagle, not a wise owl, not even a particularly grumpy badger. But a single, fluffy, undeniably common goose feather, drifting gently to land on her outstretched palm. It was pristine white, utterly unremarkable, and completely, hilariously, absurd. It was a feather. A feather! The symbol of her destiny. The physical manifestation of her Calling. A goose feather.

 The collective gasp was immediate, a sudden intake of breath that sounded like a thousand deflating balloons, followed by a ripple of whispers that quickly escalated into a full-blown uproar, like a flock of startled pigeons suddenly realizing they’d been invited to a cat convention. “A… a feather?” someone shrieked, the disbelief echoing through the square. “The Mayor’s daughter? A goose feather?!” The words were laced with a mixture of shock, amusement, and thinly veiled contempt. Mayor Raines’s face, a masterpiece of barely contained fury, went from a healthy political flush to a mottled purple, then a rather alarming shade of puce. His carefully constructed world, built on the solid foundations of tradition and impressive Callings, was crumbling around him, all because of a single, fluffy feather. He looked as though he might spontaneously combust from sheer indignation.

Ana, despite the humiliation, felt a strange, almost giddy sense of triumph. She had defied them. Not with a grand gesture, not with a dramatic pronouncement, but with a quiet, feathery rebellion. It was perfect. It was absurd. It was *hers*. She glanced towards the edge of the crowd, her eyes searching, desperate for a familiar face, a sign of understanding. And there he was. David. His face was etched with quiet, desperate concern, his hand instinctively reaching for hers, a silent anchor in the pandemonium. He looked heartbroken for her, but also, she thought, a little bit proud. And perhaps, just perhaps, a little bit amused. A faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips, a shared secret in the midst of the chaos. He understood. And that, for Ana, was everything.

## Scene 3: The Aftermath and the Ultimatum

The Mayor’s study, usually a sanctuary of hushed tones and strategic pronouncements, was now a pressure cooker of barely contained rage. The rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner sounded suspiciously like a death knell for Ana’s future, each tick a hammer blow against her already bruised spirit. Mayor Raines, a coiled spring of barely contained fury, paced the room like a caged lion, his face still a mottled purple, occasionally punctuated by alarming shades of puce. Elara, poor Elara, had fainted twice and was currently being revived with smelling salts by a particularly stern-looking maid who seemed to view fainting as a personal affront to her efficiency.

“A goose feather!” Mayor Raines roared, his voice cracking with indignation, a sound that could curdle milk and shatter glass. “My daughter! The daughter of the Mayor of Millbrook! Reduced to… to a common fowl! The shame! The utter, unmitigated shame! This is an outrage! A mockery of everything we stand for!” He slammed his fist on his desk, making the inkwell jump and a small, porcelain figurine of a particularly dignified sheep Calling topple over. “This is David’s doing! He has poisoned your mind, Ana! He has corrupted you! He has filled your head with these… these rebellious notions!”

Ana stood before him, outwardly composed, her spine rigid, but inside, a storm raged. Her heart ached for David, for the humiliation he must be enduring, wherever he was. But a fierce, defiant spark still flickered within her, a tiny ember that refused to be extinguished. “My Calling is my own, Father,” she said, her voice steady, though it trembled slightly, a fragile thread of defiance against his booming rage. “It is not David’s doing. It is… who I am. Perhaps the Portal saw something in me that you refuse to acknowledge. Perhaps it saw… freedom.”

“Nonsense!” he thundered, his face contorted with a mixture of fury and desperation. “You are a Raines! You are destined for greatness! This… this aberration… it will be rectified. There is only one way to salvage our family’s honor, to restore order, to silence the whispers that are already spreading like wildfire through the village.” He stopped pacing, his eyes narrowing, cold and calculating, like a predator assessing its prey. “You will marry Kael. Immediately. It is the only way. He is a strong, honorable man. He will… guide you. He will ensure you understand your place. And he will ensure that… that orphan… never darkens our doorstep again.” His voice dropped to a chilling whisper, a threat that hung heavy in the air, unspoken but palpable. He would ruin David. He would crush him. He would make him disappear. Ana knew it. And she couldn’t let that happen.

Her internal struggle was agonizing, a battle between her love for David and her desperate need to protect him from her father’s wrath. The silence in the room stretched, suffocating her, each tick of the grandfather clock a painful reminder of the choice she had to make. She closed her eyes, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek, a silent testament to the love she was sacrificing, to the dreams she was abandoning. When she opened them, her gaze was clear, resolute, hardened by a pain that transcended her years. “I… I accept,” she whispered, the words tasting like ash in her mouth, a bitter pill she forced herself to swallow. “I will marry Kael.”

Mayor Raines’s face softened, a flicker of triumph in his eyes. He had won. He thought. He had restored order. He had secured his legacy. But somewhere, in the shadows, a quiet resolve hardened in David’s eyes. This wasn’t over. Not by a long shot. Ana’s sacrifice, heartbreaking as it was, would not be in vain. The door clicked shut, sealing her fate, but it also sealed his determination. He would find a way. He always did. And the goose feather, now a symbol of defiance, lay forgotten on the square, waiting for its true purpose to be revealed.
