Title: Book One Master Outline (Name-Free, Creative Latitude Preserved)

Scope and Intent
This outline gives a full working skeleton for Book One with modular detail. Names, species, and titles remain placeholders so later drafts can reskin and retone without structural rewrites. The tone stays warm, witty, and romantic under pressure.

World Pillars (Adjustable)
- Setting: a river-valley settlement ringed by farms, mills, and a temple-school complex. Festivals and markets punctuate life; the Solstice is paramount.
- Callings: bonded creature-companions gained in a liminal portal rite at the Solstice. Categories loosely map to labor/status (agricultural, domestic, mediating, burden, military, religious). Prejudice follows prestige.
- Governance: a household authority (mayor-equivalent), an elders’ council, and a temple arm. The school is where doctrine becomes daily practice.
- Economy: transport, husbandry, weaving, beekeeping, milling. Legacy pride manifests as heirloom tools (e.g., loom) and pedigreed calling-lines.
- Religion and Ritual: hymns, banners, oaths; ritualized hearings confer moral gravity on mundane discipline.

Core Cast by Function
- Protagonist: orphan-adjacent, clever, loyal; allergic to rigid lanes; unknown origins create social friction and curiosity.
- Counterpart: heir to a prestigious lineage; torn between love and duty; learns to strategize from within the machine.
- Caregiver: sardonic guide; their calling-animal is a chaos agent whose blunt wisdom cuts through pretense.
- Rival: model citizen; weaponized by institutions; victory masks insecurity.
- Teacher: severe on the surface; quietly protective within narrow constraints.
- Household Authority: parent/guardian who treats destiny as logistics and risk management.
- Crowd: gossips, shopkeepers, apprentices; a living barometer of what the world permits.

Magic/Mechanic Clarifications
- The portal does not “assign” at random; it resonates with who one is becoming. Culture mislabels resonance as fate to preserve order.
- Pre-Calling binding (marriage, vow, pledge) tangles two trajectories; institutions resist it because it reduces predictability and lineage legibility.
- Calling-animals have personalities; some toe the party line, some critique it. They can speak; voice-timbre can signal status.

Act-by-Act Breakdown
Act I: Set the Lived Stakes
1) Opening Tension: overheard debate about suitability; household calling-animal’s elegant disdain frames love as inefficiency.
2) Private Conspiracy: the pair plans a pre-ritual binding; the caregiver cautions with insult-laced affection.
3) Village Tour: market bustle, school yard, temple steps; humor via petty competitions and the caregiver’s calling-animal.
4) Classroom Doctrine: taxonomy of callings; safety and procedure; historical anecdotes that sanctify conformity.
5) Promise Scene: the pair articulate what freedom looks like in specific sensory terms (a place, a craft, a shared object).

Act II: Attempt and Capture
6) Escape Montage: festival cover; near-misses; a comedic betrayal by an uncooperative animal; a real brush with danger.
7) Road Interlude: stars, streams, cheap bread; tenderness without melodrama; glimpses of alternative lives.
8) Roadside Mirrors: beekeeper, acolyte, caravan; each offers a worldview sentence that sticks.
9) Interception: Rival arrives with borrowed authority and household muscle; leverage is legal and social, not merely physical.
10) Return and Hearing: ritual theater turns love into a violation; the crowd participates and doubts in the same breath.

Act III: Aftermath and Pressure
11) Separation: routines reassert control; small mercies keep the Protagonist afloat; the Counterpart learns the choreography of obedience.
12) School as Cage: lessons echo like edicts; humor reappears as survival tool; the teacher chooses careful leniency once.
13) Edict of Arrangement: a timetable for the Counterpart’s future; the Rival’s reward; a door quietly left ajar by a conflicted calling-animal.
14) Caregiver’s Gambit: direct appeal to the household calling-animal; prophecy-in-a-joke about the cost of breaking a spirit.

Act IV: Threshold and Promise
15) Festival Build: the settlement glows with preparation; motifs (feather, chalk, loom, ledger) recur with new meaning.
16) Briefing and Rules: buddy ropes, hazard lists, whispered shortcuts; droll callouts by the teacher’s calling-animal.
17) The Breath: the pair shares a wordless pact; no deus ex machina—only courage.
18) The Open: portal light; sounds quiet to a bell-tone; step forward; end.

Subplot Modules (Plug-and-Play)
- Loom Expectation: a family investment in a specific calling exposes sunk-cost bias; comic, then poignant.
- Twin Contrast: one sibling rebels, one drifts; both care; they refract the theme without stealing focus.
- Temple Doubter: a believer who helps once out of pity, once out of conviction.
- Messenger Thread: small calling relays notes until it is intercepted; consequences ripple.

Tone and Texture
- Keep dialogue crisp and specific; lace jokes into pain, not over it.
- Use sensory beats to cut exposition: smell of mill-dust, taste of festival syrup, weight of a borrowed cloak.
- Avoid omniscient lectures; let rules appear in use.

Chapter Cadence (30-ish, Modular)
- Opening quartet: domestic tension, social map, doctrine lesson, intimate promise.
- Middle stretch: attempt, road, mirrors, capture, public spectacle, aftermath.
- Final run: pressure, festival, rules, brink.

Foreshadowing Queue (Book Two Seeds)
- Hints that resonance in the portal can defy ranking logic.
- A quiet kindness from the Rival that doesn’t fit their image.
- An institutional crack in the teacher or household authority that widens later.

Red Lines and Open Spaces
- No fixed names or species; keep room to flip prestige (e.g., sheep can be noble or comic later).
- The hearing scene must indict the system without humiliating characters beyond repair.
- The caregiver’s calling-animal is loud but never cruel to the vulnerable.

Target Outcomes
- Readers care about the pair before stakes explode.
- The culture feels coherent without over-explanation.
- The final image compels the next book.
