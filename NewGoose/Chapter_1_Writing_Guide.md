# Writing Guide: Chapter 1 - "Whispers Behind Walls"

**Word Count Target:** 3,000 - 3,500 words

### 1. Chapter Description
This chapter introduces the central conflict of Book 1 through the eyes of David. He is hiding and overhears his love, Ana, defending their relationship to her powerful and disapproving father, Mayor Raines. The scene establishes the core themes of love versus social status, the importance of Callings in this society, and the personalities of the key players. It ends with Ana's defiant declaration to marry David before their Callings, setting the plot in motion.

### 2. Flow From Prologue
This chapter serves as a direct tonal and temporal contrast to the prologue.

*   **From Epic to Personal:** Where the prologue was ancient, epic, and steeped in tragedy ("The Dragon's Last Flight"), this chapter is immediate, personal, and grounded in the relatable anxieties of a young man in love. The grand, historical scale of the dragon prophecy gives way to a small, intimate conflict in a stable yard.
*   **Connecting the Legacy:** The prologue establishes the existence of a hidden dragon lineage. This chapter introduces David as an "orphan" and "nobody," creating dramatic irony. The audience knows he has a powerful destiny, which makes Mayor Raines' dismissal of him as being "from nowhere" all the more poignant and shortsighted. The grand secret of the prologue is now the quiet reality of our protagonist's life.

### 3. Scene-by-Scene Breakdown

**Scene 1: The Hiding Place (Approx. 600 words)**
*   **Setting:** Behind the whitewashed stone wall of the Raines' family stable. It’s late afternoon, with golden light casting long shadows. The air smells of hay, horses, and expensive leather.
*   **Action:** David is pressed against the wall, trying to be invisible. He’s uncomfortable, with chalk dust staining his simple, well-worn shirt. He peeks around the corner, his heart pounding.
*   **Internal Monologue:** Establish David’s anxiety and feelings of inadequacy. He feels like an intruder in this world of wealth and power. He is here for Ana, the only reason he would ever dare come this close to the Mayor's domain.
*   **Sensory Details:** Focus on the contrast between his world and theirs – the clean stone vs. his dusty clothes, the scent of well-groomed animals vs. the herby, earthy smell of his own home.

**Scene 2: The Argument (Approx. 1,500 words)**
*   **Characters:** Ana, Mayor Raines, and his Calling, the stallion Midnight.
*   **Action:** The core confrontation. Ana passionately defends David and her right to choose her own husband. Mayor Raines systematically dismisses David, focusing on his lack of lineage, status, and known Calling.
*   **Dialogue:**
    *   Ana's dialogue should be filled with youthful fire, idealism, and a touch of frustration. She references her grandmother to make a historical point, showing she is intelligent and has thought this through.
    *   Mayor Raines' dialogue is calm, authoritative, and condescending. He uses terms like "child" to diminish her. He speaks of family, legacy, and risk, framing his prejudice as parental concern.
    *   Midnight, the stallion, speaks with a deep, rumbling voice. He is not malicious, but his words carry the weight of tradition and social order. He sides with the Mayor, which should be a gut punch to David.
*   **David's Reaction:** From his hiding place, David experiences a rollercoaster of emotions: pride in Ana's defense, shame at the Mayor's insults, a sting of betrayal when the horse speaks, and a surge of defiant self-worth when he internally defends geese.

**Scene 3: The Declaration and Aftermath (Approx. 900 words)**
*   **Action:** Ana, pushed to her limit, makes her defiant declaration: "That is exactly why I am going to marry him, before his calling." This is the turning point. The Mayor delivers his final ultimatum, forbidding her from seeing David, and then leaves. Ana is left alone, her defiance momentarily crumbling into despair.
*   **David's Emergence:** David waits until the Mayor is gone before revealing himself. The mood shifts from a public confrontation to an intimate, private moment.
*   **Resolution:** They comfort each other. David admits the Mayor's words hurt, and Ana reassures him. The chapter ends not with a solution, but with a shared promise: they will find a way. This solidifies their bond and sets up the next chapter's goal.

### 4. Plot and Subplots

*   **Main Plot:** The forbidden love story is established as the primary plotline. The inciting incident is Ana's declaration to marry David before the Calling, which creates a clear goal and a ticking clock.
*   **Subplot 1 (Introduction): The Mystery of David's Origins.** The Mayor's line "he is nobody, from nowhere" directly (and ironically) points to this subplot. David's status as an orphan raised by a GooseCaller is established, creating questions for the reader that the prologue has already started to answer.
*   **Subplot 2 (Introduction): The Social and Political Power of Callings.** This chapter clearly establishes the social hierarchy. Horsemasters are at the top, GooseCallers are looked down upon. The Mayor's power is tied directly to his family's Calling legacy. This introduces the political undercurrents that will become more important later.

### 5. Character Arcs and Development

*   **David:** Starts the chapter feeling insecure and out of place. While he doesn't magically become confident, seeing Ana's faith in him and making a pact with her solidifies his resolve. He moves from passive hiding to active commitment.
*   **Ana:** Is shown to be more than a rebellious child. She is principled and willing to fight for her beliefs. Her arc in this chapter is from defending her love to creating an active plan (or at least the goal of one), moving from a defensive to an offensive position.
*   **Mayor Raines:** Established as the primary antagonist for Book 1. He is not a simple villain; his motivations are rooted in love for his daughter and a deep-seated belief in a system that has benefited his family for generations.

### 6. Foreshadowing

*   **"An unknown boy with an unknown Calling":** This line is heavy with dramatic irony and foreshadows the massive shock David's Calling will be.
*   **Ana's focus on marrying *before* the Calling:** While presented as a romantic necessity, this can be subtly seeded as a potential sign of her own fear of the Calling system, hinting at her own future shocking result. (This is a seed for her potential betrayal/manipulation arc).
*   **The Stallion's dismissal of a "gooseling":** This sets up the eventual comedic and dramatic reversal when David's Calling is a dragon, and the "noble" horse lineage is paired with a "lowly" rat.
*   **Ana's reference to her Grandmother's unique Calling:** This establishes that unusual Callings can happen and can be powerful, subtly preparing the reader for more significant deviations from the norm.

### 7. Dialogue and Humor Notes

*   **Humor:** The primary source of humor is David's internal monologue and whispered reactions while hiding. His indignant defense of geese ("Geese are noble, majestic creatures!") should be a moment of levity in a tense scene. The stallion's snobbery can also be played for a touch of satirical humor.
*   **Key Line:** Ana's "That is exactly why I am going to marry him, before his calling" is the thesis statement for the first act of the book and must be delivered with unwavering conviction.
*   **Voice Contrast:** Ensure a clear difference between Ana's passionate, youthful voice and her father's measured, authoritative tone.
