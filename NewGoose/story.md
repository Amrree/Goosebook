Title: The Young Man, His Love, and the Goose (Story Sketch + Prompts)

A young man grew up at the edge of a village that loved its rules almost as much as it loved its festivals. He had no famous lineage and no tidy story to tuck behind his name. What he had was a stubborn kindness, a talent for noticing the small, and a house that always smelled faintly of herbs and river wind. He also had a goose—loud, opinionated, and weirdly wise—who belonged to the elder who raised him and, increasingly, to him. The goose never missed a chance to harangue pretension and peck at pomposity, which made it terrible at diplomacy and perfect at truth.

He fell in love the sort of way that sneaks up on you: a shared joke at the well, a glance held a second longer in the school yard, a secret spoken when twilight hid the edges of things. His love lived under a roof where duty was a language spoken fluently. The household believed that destiny should be logged and scheduled, like wagon shipments and market dues. Affection was fine in its place—preferably framed by lineage and approved by council stamp.

In this village, each youth would, on the longest night, step through a portal and return with a calling-creature bound to them—a voice, a companion, sometimes a burden and often a badge. The world pretended the portal assigned fate; the young man suspected it revealed it. He and his love decided, quietly and carefully, that they would bind themselves to each other before the night arrived, so the future would have to respect what they had already chosen.

They planned an escape in the soft spaces between chores—maps rolled with bread, a rickety cart that squeaked only on even-numbered turns, a promise made with hands and breath instead of ink and seal. The goose objected in the way only a friend can: too loud, too honest, and absolutely unwilling to let them confuse courage with haste. Still, the bird’s eyes softened; still, it stood, wings out, when they needed cover.

Under lanterns and hymn-songs, the pair slipped away. The road was not kind, but it was theirs. They learned the taste of choice: where to sleep, what to share, which star to name for which wish. They traded with strangers and learned from them, too—how order can save a life and ruin one just as easily, how faith can steady you or bind you, how freedom is sometimes a hunger you keep feeding.

But a village does not love to lose what it thinks it owns. They were brought back—not with shackles, but with the sort of authority that looks like kindness from a distance. In front of neighbors and elders, their love was remeasured and pronounced impractical. Shame is a theater art in places that fear change. The young man stood smaller and still somehow taller. The goose made a scene that was both scandalous and necessary, and for a breath the room remembered laughter.

They were separated. Days turned into tasks, lessons into edicts. Yet even discipline has seams. A teacher’s glance softened. A door stayed unlocked a moment longer. Through all of it, the young man held to the simple promise: to walk toward the future with the person who had already become part of his breath.

The longest night arrived. Lanterns stitched light through the dark. Rules were recited; ropes were measured; warnings were given in dry tones by creatures who had seen too much. The portal hummed like a held note. The young man and his love stood apart and together, hands at their sides, eyes forward. The goose muttered one last unprintable benediction. Then the light widened, and the step they had been preparing for all along finally found their feet.
What returned from the light was not silence but heat: a coil of smoke and ember that blinked into a small, river-colored dragon, all wet stone and candle-flame eyes. It breathed once, and the lanterns along the walls shivered as if they'd been caught listening.

Across the rope, her hand trembled, then steadied. At her heel slipped a rat—sleek as oiled grain, whiskers bright as tuning wire. It looked up at her the way questions do: without apology.

The hall inhaled its surprise. Prestige has habits; this did not fit them. The dragon wound itself around the young man’s wrist like a warm bracelet of winter fire. The rat climbed to her shoulder and regarded the elders with a patience that felt like verdict.

The goose laughed, a scandal and a blessing in one. "Finally," it said, "a fire that cooks and a mind that cleans the corners."

He met her eyes. In front of rules and ropes, the future stopped pretending it belonged to anyone else.

AI Writing Prompts (Use this sketch to draft scenes)
- Style and POV: Write in close third-person limited from the young man’s perspective. Keep prose sensory, specific, and lightly witty. Let the goose’s dialogue puncture tension without undercutting stakes.
- Voice of the Goose: Give the goose short, incisive lines that blend barnyard metaphor with inconvenient truth. No cutesy baby-talk; it is clever, blunt, and deeply loyal.
- Tone Targets: Slow-burn romance, humane humor, escalating societal pressure. End chapters on decision, discovery, or friction, not on summary.
- World Texture: Show the village through work—mills, looms, ledgers, market banter—and through ritual: hymns, lanterns, hearings. Reveal rules through use, not lecture.
- The Portal: Treat it as resonance, not assignment. Keep its mechanics suggestive, not fully explained. Focus on emotion and sensory strangeness.
- Reveal: Let the dragon and rat arrive as resonance, not rank; keep wonder over spectacle.
- Scene Seeds: (1) The overheard debate and the first secret vow. (2) A market-morning sequence where the goose humiliates a bully with a single sentence. (3) The escape under festival noise. (4) Roadside tenderness with a borrowed blanket and star-naming. (5) The public hearing that weaponizes ritual. (6) Return to school where chalk dust feels like snowfall and sentence.
- Do Nots: Avoid hard-coded names and fixed species hierarchies. No “Scene:” headings—signal transitions with setting and action.
