 David, a young man with a mysterious past, an orphan, is in love with Ana, daughter of Mr. Raines, a powerful and respected Horsemaster, who family has been training horses for over a century. A Calling is a gift each individual receives at age 18, a unique talking creature that sets them apart from others. Ana Raines comes from a family of horse Callers, her father being the most respected Horsemaster in the town and the mayor. His mother was the first horse Calling in the town for over a century, She called a Mare, enabling the family to breed horses with exceptional qualities and found a dynasty that became the biggest transporter of goods in the continent. David, on the other hand, was an orphan, raised by a gooseCaller, an old cranky medicine woman that loved him like a son. He had a mysterious past, and his Calling was unknown. David and Ana are are 16 and attend the village school  



The main issue is once a couple is married, their Callings are combined, creating a new Calling that is unique to them. This new Calling can be a powerful force, but it can also be dangerous, as it can lead to the destruction of the natural world. or it can lead to a happy normal life. I want this story to be funny and entertaining, with a touch of romance and adventure. This happens much later but i want it setup.
 i want lots of dialogues and interactions between characters. A memorable meeting with a David's adopted grandmother, and her Calling, a goose mother with a real attitude problem, and basically toreetes, she doesn't think Ana, or her family, is worth the trouble. She is a wise old goose who has seen it all and knows how to handle any situation.
If a couple don't marry before their calling, it's up to the mayor, failing that, then the council of elders, then the queen herself to pair up callings. 
Anas father manages to stop the wedding before it happens, but the first book will be that set up


Early Book One
The early book will be village life, with everything that is interesting and important to the characters. This will be a slow burn, with a lot of dialogues and interactions between characters, but humor - this will also introduce school and the other children in the village - 
we need a very funny and memorable teacher, with his Calling being stern and a hard task master, or vice versa. We need a host of other children, learning their about their own Callings, add in davids main rival, a rich kid with two frinends remesent of Malfoy and his goones. We need the classic farm boys, that "hope and pray that their calling is a sheep be cause mama bought a new loom in prepertion for their brothers calling last year, and he called an egle and not a sheep and mama is still annoyed." that is humor we need - add in a set of twins, girl and boy, smart and dopey one.

Some grab and run, others are more diserning, have the teacher and his calling tell them all about it. Next is type of callings, they are divided into many types, for example agricaultural callings, social callings, domestic callings, burden callings, military callings, and religious callings.- we are still deveolping this system - each child leaves with their calling to say millaray school - they lern this in school and have a laugh, but David and Ana have a secrite, theyre in love and plan on elopping -
