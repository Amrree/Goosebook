# The Goose and the Mayor's Daughter - Plot Outline

## Core Story
A young orphan named David and Ana, the mayor's daughter, fall in love in a village where everyone's destiny is determined by a magical Solstice Portal that assigns them animal companions (Callings). They decide to bind themselves to each other before the ritual can assign their fates, defying tradition and social expectations.

## Main Characters

8. **Road Mirrors**: Travelers show different possible futures - duty-bound, faith-driven, or free
9. **Interception**: Kael, promised favor, intercepts them with borrowed authority
10. **Public Hearing**: Ritual theater turns their love into a violation, crowd enforces spectacle

### Act III: Aftermath and Pressure

## Key Themes
- **Freedom vs Assignment**: Choosing your own destiny vs accepting what's assigned
- **Love vs Utility**: Genuine connection vs strategic marriage
- **Tradition vs Reform**: Challenging established systems
- **Identity as Discovery**: Finding who you are rather than being told

## Magic System
- **Callings**: Animal companions gained through Solstice Portal ritual
- **Categories**: Map to labor/status (agricultural, domestic, military, religious, etc.)
- **Pre-Calling Binding**: Marriage/vows before ritual creates ambiguity elders dislike
- **Resonance vs Assignment**: Portal reveals who you're becoming, doesn't randomly assign

## Ending
Book One closes at the portal's opening - choice imminent, destinies unread. The story ends with David and Ana standing together in intent, ready to face whatever the Solstice Portal reveals, having chosen each other regardless of what fate assigns them.
