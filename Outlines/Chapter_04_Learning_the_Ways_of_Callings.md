## Scene Breakdown

### Scene 1: The Agricultural Calling - A Day in the Fields
**Location**: The village fields, early morning
**Purpose**: To humorously depict the realities of an Agricultural Calling and Ana's witty observations.
**Key Elements**:
- Ana and David, ostensibly "helping" with the harvest, but mostly Ana making wry comments about the back-breaking labor and the villagers' unwavering dedication to dirt.
- Barnaby, in his element, passionately explaining the nuances of sheep shearing or crop rotation, completely oblivious to Ana's internal eye-rolls.
- Ana's attempts at manual labor, resulting in comedic mishaps (e.g., accidentally watering a scarecrow, mistaking a turnip for a potato).
- David's quiet competence, effortlessly handling tasks while subtly helping Ana avoid disaster.

**Writing Notes**:
- Emphasize the physical comedy of Ana's struggles and her sharp internal monologue.
- Use Barnaby's earnestness for comedic contrast.
